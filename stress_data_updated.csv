1,"College stress  So recently college has had me feeling extremely stressed out and on the verge of a an anxiety attack. 

This is something that‚Äôs been building up over my last 3 years in college it started off fine even though going to college was very last minute for me and I chose a course I thought I‚Äôd enjoy being game development, which isn‚Äôt going as expected, meeting great new people and some old ones going to the same place. 

But as things went on after my first year stuff just changed so much, most of my friends I knew before college grew distant and I never knew why, some of my new class mates began mocking me nearly every day due to failing a few modules of first year but still managing to pass them during resits over the summer at the start I thought it was just a laugh taking the piss with each other but after a while it just felt as direct insults this made me not feel welcome in class which led to me falling behind and inevitably failing second year to which I chose to repeat it the next year. 

But as this year went on any enjoyment or interest in my course disappeared and with what I feel as constant pressure of ‚Äúbeing so smart to do a course like that‚Äù which I‚Äôm sick of hearing or pressure about getting a degree and a good job. I want to change my course but I feel like I‚Äôm too far in and feel that I‚Äôll just get more judgement from people for giving up on what I started off with and this thought brought me to tears for the first time in a long time. 

I‚Äôve taken the first step by planning a meeting with a careers officer in my college but it‚Äôs explaining to others especially my family has me worried of what they‚Äôll think I just want to know that what I‚Äôm doing is the best choice ",Stressed
2,"Stress Blackouts?  Hey, just wondering if some of you go through the same thing. An overload of stress that leads to forgetting most of the day from the point where the stress starts to the point where it dies out. Happens to me almost every day at work at this point and it‚Äôs driving me nuts. I have diagnosed ADHD, anxiety, and depression, so I stay stressed most of the time anyways, but it‚Äôs worse at work.",Stressed
3,"Chronic Stress Dreams!  I have been on a variety of different mental health medications for a decade now. For as long as I can remember (the last 4-5 years at least) i experience frequent bad dreams i call ‚Äústress dreams‚Äù. They are most often about messing up at work or getting fired. I also experience similar dreams related to past trauma.
 I was wondering if anyone here could give any insight as to what these dreams may be a symptom of?

4,"Stress-induced mutism  Hi, I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has mutism in extremely stressful situations. I‚Äôm talking about losing the physical ability to use your voice. It has happened to me three times now and every one is scary. The first time pretty much cost me my job, as my mind blanked in the middle of a speech to 300 people, which was being recorded. I totally forgot the entire training but couldn‚Äôt explain that to the audience. It was a nightmare and I didn‚Äôt know what was happening. I cried until they sent me home, then all night. My speech didn‚Äôt come back until the next morning.

The second time was when I had a threesome with a couple I didn‚Äôt like at all. They were friends of friends and not my type. I had a bad gut feeling about them and what we were up to but I went against my better judgment. I was so extremely uncomfortable. The second the guy took off his clothes, I went mute. Thinking back now, none of us should have gone there because we had been drinking and doing hard drugs; however, I was unable to say no. I couldn‚Äôt say anothing at all to make him stop. So they didn‚Äôt really have my consent, because I couldn‚Äôt give it. They didn‚Äôt even notice I couldn‚Äôt speak. Today, I would consider reporting them.

The last time (so far) this has happened was just a few days ago. I dropped my Apple Watch and needed it fixed, so I had changed my Apple password just before I brought it in - it was something easy for me to remember purposely, because sometimes I have severe trouble with my memory, ever since ECT. When the Apple tech who was working on my watch asked for my password, I could feel my brain blank, I mean everything drained away until there was nothing left, and I went mute again. I tried to speak to him but couldn‚Äôt answer so the friend who was with me who knows about this intervened and we got what we needed to do done but it was scary. Very scary. My voice came back when we got home.

I hate when this happens but my psychiatrist and therapist both have said it‚Äôs related to PTSD and also to a lesser extent, anxiety. And that it will continue until I can process what happened in my past and get my anxiety under control. Well, they might as well have told me to bring the moon home in a handbasket. They said it‚Äôs NOT a bipolar thing because it‚Äôs a coping skill I learned as an abused child so I‚Äôd be silent, but I dont remember it happening before? But much of my childhood is blank since it was so bad. I‚Äôm just wondering, has anyone have it or heard of it?

TLDR: when I‚Äôm under severe stress, I physically lose the ability to speak. Doctors think it‚Äôs a PTSD response from childhood. Wondering if anyone else has it or has heard of it.",Stressed

7,"Stress and loneliness   
Hi everyone, this is my first post here and this sub came first to my mind for that weird thing that's been happening to me for the last 1 week. 

I'm 28M from a South Asian country, have social anxiety and am introvert. I'm writing my master's thesis in a German university. Now, I'm a huge procrastinator and from the get go, I knew that I'd be in big trouble and here I am, stressful as heck. I cannot sleep and my appetite has gone out the window. 

Now, for the last few days, my mind is going towards my friends and family a little too much, which is an anomaly given, although that I care for them and am extremely close with at least my family, I was never someone who calls to the same person twice to check on them (mum and brother). I have just finished talking with one of my school friends for an hour! 

I cannot point finger on the underlying philosophy of my sudden caring behaviour. I'd be glad to hear any opinions/experience of yours. Thanks

Tldr: stressful days, all of a sudden start calling fnf a little too much. ",Stressed

9,"Work stress getting to me  I started a new job a few months ago, at first I was constantly stressed out trying to do my absolute best and still feeling like I was failing. A couple of weeks ago it feels like a switch flipped and I've been much calmer since then at the expense of my motivation.

I'm so tired of feeling like I need to give 100% to this job every single day knowing that still won't be enough. I don't want to go to work tomorrow. :( 

I've gone from my brain being unable to switch off, constantly trying to find solutions (anxiety?) to being avoidant and unmotivated (more of a depressive response?).

My manager is nice but they don't get mental health or the impact their unrealistic expectations are having on me. I feel like telling them how I'm feeling will make them lose confidence in me/think I'm crazy.

10,"Anxiety and stress are ruining me  I‚Äôm(18M) finishing my second semester of college soon and I am going to fail 3 of my courses because I‚Äôm too anxious to do the work, and now I‚Äôm too anxious to go to them entirely. I‚Äôm going to withdraw from them but I don‚Äôt know what I should do for next year. Do I schedule classes for the summer semester (will I fail then too?)to keep my scholarship, do I drop out, do I take a gap year? I don‚Äôt know how to tell my parents about this either since I don‚Äôt even fully understand why I can‚Äôt get my lazy ass to do work that arguably isn‚Äôt that difficult.

I hate myself and know I can‚Äôt keep avoiding difficult tasks and situations all my life but I can‚Äôt change myself to handle them. I want to see a therapist or a psychiatrist so I could maybe get a medication or just any actually useful help, but I can‚Äôt get myself to go, or even set up an appointment. I‚Äôm disappointing myself.

11,"What does stress actually feel like?  I have been looking online and I have noticed that some things I‚Äôm experiencing are also symptoms of stress. Eg find it hard to concentrate, losing interest in sex, snap at ppl, unable to remember things etc. What I knew stress to be was when you are cramming study or submitting a last minute assignment or trying to get something done quickly or have a big task and panicking trying to get them done etc. If someone asked me do I feel stressed I would say no.

12,"Why is my stress reaction so extreme   Hey all, I will make this short. I 22(nb) am a generally calm person. I process my emotions slowly when it comes to major events and rationalize them. Such as a family member falling ill or losing a best friend. 

But when it comes to moderate things like hunger, discomfort, a change of plans, or even a perceived slight, I react with a lot more aggression and sensitivity.

I have no friends at school and I managed to make almost everyone from my online friendgroup drop me lmfaoo. My emotions are basically gone. The only thing I feel is numbness and pressure in my forehead or pain on my upper back and neck. I‚Äôm in my early teens and dealing with issues people don‚Äôt have until they enter their late forties probably. It‚Äôs just frustrating.

18,"Stress is brining out weird mental issues?   I am a junior in college, and as you could imagine the past couple years have been pretty stressful ones, but this current semester is especially rough. I‚Äôve been having a lot of stress and have also struggled with sleeping enough. I think these things are leading to weird mental stress, and it‚Äôs causing me to have tons of guilt/anxiety/self hate about thoughts (key thing here is thoughts, not actions) I had when I was in the first half of my teens. I won‚Äôt go into what exactly these thoughts were, but there were just a few, with each probably occurring no more than twice. they were all very sexual things that would not be considered ok by most (that includes myself) no obsession/fixation ever occurred with these thoughts and I never had the slightest urge to make them anything besides a thought. This phase of hyper sexual thoughts (a majority of which were perfectly normal) lasted if I had to guess from 14-16 (now 21.) Since then to now I‚Äôve been totally normal with no regard to those very few disturbing thoughts. I lead a normal life and have a very healthy relationship and sex life. I‚Äôm so confused why years later bad thoughts I had as a teen are coming back and wreaking havoc on my brain?! I have a pretty good memory but I still find it super bizarre that this has surfaced, aside from the moment I had those thoughts they never crossed my mind again until now. I find it revolting and shameful, I feel like I am not a good person and I‚Äôm just as bad as a criminal. How can thoughts from years ago make me feel like I actually did something really bad? I am still going through my day without being entirely miserable, but it‚Äôs getting more and more difficult to write off these feeling that I‚Äôve described. 
What is happening? Am I as horrible as my brain is telling me I am? Any feedback is appreciated.

19,"How to handle stress?  I'm very sensitive to stressful situations. It's really hard to manage it. Yesterday I started my driving class, it was my first time driving a car. The instructor I got is an old guy who seems kind of cold and might sound mean. He didn't say anything too mean, but I could sense him growing frustrated with me. My legs were shaking for the whole ride, my mouth was so dry and at the end, I almost cried there. When I came back home I immediately felt like dropping my class, that it was too scary and I wouldn't be a good driver. I'm trying my best to push these thoughts away- that I will get better with time. But my anxiety seems to grow even more,  the next class is tomorrow and I've been feeling even more depressed and stressed. ",Stressed
20,"Addicted to politics and it causes too much stress   I have a strong sense of justice. If it weren't for my physical and mental issues I'd be a very active activist. Things being what they are it's hard just to get to the store.

I watch and read a lot of politics. I study a lot of political and economic texts. I get as riled up as anyone but at the end of the day I'm powerless to do anything. I don't have the physical or mental energy to help in any way, even from home 

I have this *need*, no this obsession with needing to know what is happening here and in the world. I see all these systems of oppression (some I'm subject to) and it stresses me out to no end. 

It's obvious I need to at least substantially reduce my diet of news and theory but it's so addictive. I just don't know what to do. Not knowing also stresses me out.

Any thoughts or suggestions?

23,"What does stress do to your body?  I have recently been laid-off and I have had the worst week in years with my mental health AND body. First day was obviously trauma induced stress- sobbing into a panic attack after finding out the news in the middle of my shift. Next 48hrs was scrambling with a few job interviews and updating my resumes for long periods of time. Now almost a week in and my body is completely sore- like my arms and legs are so tense it hurts to move! Ointments and muscle relaxers help but man this sucks. I‚Äôve also been randomly anxious in public which has been throwing me off? Thats not usually normal for me as I see myself as a very confident person.  

I haven't been re-diagnosed in years but when I was 19 I had BP2, Depression, PTSD, and mild Anxiety. I‚Äôve been stable since then (Now 22) but this is the first time i‚Äôve had such a horrible experience with my body/mental health since.

I wanna say I suffer from what I call stress blindness.. I dont know if there's any real terms for it but that's what I call it. Excuse me if my grammar is bad I also have dyslexia.

Anyways I can't tell when I'm stressed or what im stressed about until suddenly it's too late and I'm at my breaking point. I think it's cus im so used to a specific level of stress that i feel 100% fine one minute and then I'm fainting the next second. It doesn't help that i have sensory issues that come with my autism and i also am so used to conforming to society and the normalness of being a person (aka masking) that i think i gaslit myself too much and now i have issues expressing some emotions in a healthy way that is normal for a mind like mine. 

I think the hardest thing i have to come to terms with is that, i cannot change myself. I'm always going to have to work twice as hard and thats that. I cant expect people who are normal to change their world veiws for me, especially strangers. 

But it does suck.

I plan on going to therapy soon so i hope that helps but my last therapist couldnt get it in her head why i had such a very very hard time talking to her and eventually i had to just stop scheduling appointments because it stressed me out way too much having to deal with her.

29,"Sensitive friends causing stress and anxiety  I've got this really dear friend who means a lot to me. But there's something that's stressing me out whenever I hang out with them. They're very sensitive, and even though I'm always careful about what I say or do around them, they sometimes take things the wrong way and get upset over stuff that I wouldn't expect would lead to this kind of reaction or they get mad over things that I didn't mean any harm with. It's like I am walking on egg shells when I talk to them and I always have to think twice whenever I say or do anything to them, but sometimes I still manage to tick them off. And instead of talking it out, they just get distant or passive-aggressive. Whenever their mood changes, I start feeling intense anxiety because I don't know what I did wrong or how to fix it. But I'm scared to bring it up with them because they're  dealing with depression, and I don't want to make things worse for them.  


The thing is, I care about them a lot, and I'll always stand by their side. No matter what they need, whenever they reach out, I'll be there and will support them through everything they're going through. I understand that it's not them but the depression that's causing these issues. However, not knowing how they'll react to my words or actions is affecting me as well. I often push aside my own feelings just to support them. Lately, though, I've been feeling very stressed and anxious because this has been happening more and more often.

31,"I feel like I'm addicted to stress.  So here's some quick lore on to how this started.

Earlier this year, I thought I had a rootkit on my computer (Really advanced, hard to remove Malware)

I developed a habit of observing small details happening on my system I felt were unusual.

Some of these were watching how many times the mouse would turn into a blue wheel, watching for any programs I didn't recognised, etc.

I find out one of my computer issues, Command prompt flashing sometimes on start-up is said to be completely fine.

However after I decided to run a program called MSERT (An official Microsoft security program), which I used on both my current and old laptops around the same time, the issue just seemingly stopped for both of them. The old device said It found a virus, the new one didn't.

This of course, Got me incredibly stressed.

About a month later I called up my local tech repair man to see If my current laptop could get checked, after about a week I got my device back and he said there was nothing wrong with it, even after scanning with all the Anti-Viruses he commonly used.

Now while I'm trying to unwind, My brain won't keep thinking about the small details I forgot to tell him, Though considering I already called back to him once after getting my device, I don't want to pester him over and over for what could most likely be me acting like a schizo.

34,"Stress induced hallucination?  So I have this friend, we met over a year ago in college and we quickly became close, but he turned out to be incredibly toxic and an alcoholic. After one night he came on to me knowing I have a boyfriend, and I got so triggered that I attempted to take my life that night.

The following morning I sent him one last text, and blocked him on everything.

The following days I was very scared that he was on a bender because our shared friends hadn‚Äôt seen him anywhere, and I was scared he might‚Äôve taken his own life (I had to call an ambulance on him earlier this year because he was threatening suicide) 

He also lives in the same apartment complex as me, and had visited my place many times, so I was afraid he would show up.

One day I was walking to my car to go to Walmart and I clear as day saw him standing still in the grass by my car, I recognized his clothes and everything, he  was staring straight at me. He looked blank and dead and incredibly angry.
I immediately drove away and called my boyfriend, I was hysterical and so so scared.

When I came back home, he was nowhere to be found, and I didn‚Äôt see him for months.
One night I texted him to check up, and (with other people around) invited him over to chat.

We talked a lot mostly about how he was doing better, and I finally asked about that one day I saw him. I said I was scared he was stalking me.
After I told him he looked so confused, and said he had been home with his family that day. I didn‚Äôt believe him, I thought he was embarrassed and lying, but he showed me a picture of him and his family at the aquarium on the day I saw him, he proved it with the timestamp that you can find on IPhone pictures. There was no way he could‚Äôve been at our apartment complex when I had saw him.

This lead me to one rational conclusion, I hallucinated him. This scares me because I already have bad mental health and I am scared that my mind produced a hallucination that vivid.

37,"Are my synptoms from stress or anxiety?  1st of all sorry¬† for the English¬† you will witness 
Hello guys I am desperately looking for a solution 
I was stressful person always¬† ,but with my therapist¬† I managed to fix¬† a lot in one year and I am continuing in order¬† to find¬† a balance. 

My problem is that the line of therapy success¬† is up but my health¬† or mental health¬† is decreasing¬† (by my view)
For 10 days I am¬† having tingling¬† sensation¬† or tenderness¬† on my left hand I feel dizzy, nausea,acid reflux, feel of doom or something¬† bad is about to happen¬† to me. 
I went on every doctor ,I ve done every blood test and they were always¬† saying¬† ""man your blood test is very good "" or "" it's on your mind¬† you¬† are very healthy you have nothing to worry about¬† just manage¬† your stress "" (I am 24 years old male)
I went for gastroscopy last year¬† before I start¬† psychotherapy¬† because the pain i was feeling¬† on my stomach¬† was super bad . I couldn't¬† eat because¬† everytime¬† I was eating the feeling¬† of like lava upper left¬† would skyrocket.
Guess what¬† ? Nothing... 

You know what's unlucky ? before my symptoms start I was feeling¬† super ok and happy¬† and I just asked myself¬† ""hmmm my day is good and I am super happy there is no way this feeling¬† will last that's very sus"" and boom in one hour after I said that boom






So my question¬† is if this caused by stress or anxiety or there is something¬† I need to check?? 

Sorry¬† for my English again .",Stressed
38,"Deep, Inescapable Stress  I genuinely don't know what to do or feel in my own situation. So much of my current life right stresses me out and I feel hopeless. I don't want to feel hopeless, I know that I'm doing okay, but I can't help but spiral every single night into deep thoughts of self-loathing.

I don't have much money, and no job. I live with my grandma and my brother and my mother and grandmother pay for essentials. I live deep in a rural area of Fort Myers, Florida and I greatly despise this place, both my house and this town. I wish to leave, but again, no money. I've been sending out dozens of applications, but not a soul has called or emailed back, and it due to my rural residency, my options are few. And even when I eventually find a job, everything entry-level within 50 miles practically pays minimum wage so I'm stuck here for even longer when I do.

Public university is an option, yet with no money and a very long commute, it makes it difficult. There is student loans but I fear them since I struggle to find a job and am terrible with payments.My mental health is.. I honestly don't what to say about it as it's extremely low yet it's been for years. Loneliness, suicidality, self-loathing, anxiety, depression, the whole nine-yards. I hate this misery, I hate it deeply, my mental state is nowhere near stable but I despise my situation and want to improve it, yet I feel trapped.

There's the obvious issue of dependency on my mother and grandmother which I need to overcome, but it feels like every single facet of my own life pushes me down. I try not to sit on that thought, the victim mentality, I fear those thoughts but every objective aspect just feels off for my situation. My friends, a start, barely feel like friends. I have very few friends, and I do enjoy them sometimes yet I do not any mutual benefit from it. I'm so different compared to them, in everyway. I used to be similar but I've realized who I am, and the person they believe I am, I'm not. I struggle to take off the mask be more myself around them as I fear they'll leave me, so I sit like a coward, afraid to be myself in fear of complete loneliness.

Making friends proves to be difficult, especially for my situation. Another example of feeling hopeless yet trying to not to blame everything on the outside world. I'm 20, I'm queer, and I think I have autism; and I live in a highly conservative area and far away from any place even remotely of my own interest. By normal standards, I'm an oddball; my interests never co-align with others. I can talk to people okay, I have social anxiety but can hold a conversation, I just struggle to make connection as no-one shares the same thoughts or interests, as well as engage in conversation if I'm not directly approached.

I feel helpless in that everyone around me is so different in everyway. A good example is politically. I'm very left-leaning--as my name probably implies lol--and it always ends in frustrating arguments when I try to talk with anyone politically. Everyone around me are conservatives or pseudo-conservatives, so I usually just stay quiet or act like I agree. This, and many other examples, often send me down depressive spirals. I want to stand up for my beliefs; I want to set my boundaries and declare my needs; I want to do what I wish in life, follow my passions; yet I feel like a coward with my inability to do so. I want to tell off my mother for her narcissistic behavior and abusive tactics against me; I want to tell off my brother for his total ignorance of everyone around him and his dangerous actions; I want to tell off my friends for ignoring my messages when I'm in the middle of a panic attack; but I'm too scared to. I'm so lonely that losing my own means of socialization would drive me insane, and I've been threatened to be kicked out by my mom before and'll end up homeless. It sends me down a loop of affirmations and negative self-talk; telling myself I need to do more to fix myself and telling myself I'm doing all I can but it's not working.

It is often said that one who struggles with addiction or trauma needs a new place, a new people and a new meaning--things that I do not have. Dealing with the mounds of trauma in the same places and around the same people who perpetrated it. I want to live a happy a life, I want to pursue my passions, I want to form meaningful connections with people who feel me, understand me, love me, and won't simply leave. I want that badly and suicidal ideation creeps up closer and closer, breathing down my neck when even the slightest thought of ""my dreams will never happen."" I don't want to die, I've had suicidal thoughts since I was a preteen; I want to be there for myself, and I want to be happy.

I have a counselor I go to see, and it helps some, mainly with info about local activities and affirmations towards my current efforts. I only get an hour with them a week, which isn't enough but it's worth the $100 an hour simply to have someone to talk to. I don't do well with online friendships and online connections; face-to-face helps a lot more. It doesn't help my helpless feeling when even they are clueless as to how to help in most ways, mainly in that there really isn't many options for me here.

I just wish things would get better. Everyday, it's stress from my family, stress from money, stress from my friends, stress from my house, stress from my dogs, stress from the city I live in, stress from the state I live on, stress from the country I live in; any sense of news is about Florida hammering down on trans people and the US government flooding with borderline fascist-members, and a genocide in Gaza with record high global temperatures. It doesn't help that I also think I have BPD as I have extreme and rapid highs and lows in mood, making these things worse mentally.

I meditate--or try to--often, and I journal most days, it helps but there's always that feeling that things just aren't gonna get better. I desperately wish them to but alas, here we are.

On the good side, things aren't so bad I guess. I have a roof over my head, food to eat, my grandma is nice--I can't go to her with issues but she's helpful. My friends, while frustrating, are still people to talk to. I'm able to mentally deconstruct a lot of mental issues and work on them even moreso than counseling has helped, and I've even been able to work on my passions (I want to be a filmmaker and have been working on one and have got some friends to act in it). I'm doing terribly, yet there are glimpses of hope. Not much to do except to keep moving on, keep working try not to blow off my own head.

Sorry for overtly long message, this has been bottling up for so long and felt I had no place to turn to to talk about this. Thank you for reading. (:

Any advice is greatly appreciated, if you have any to offer.

What if you tell your family about something horrible that happened in your day & they don't respond, does that make you feel worse?

It doesn't matter if I know that I'm right or wrong, whether I think highly of the person I'm arguing with, whether the topic is important to me, or whether I feel as if I'm in any actual danger or not, I always feel highly stressed after confrontations.

The stress is very debilitating too, I often feel numb afterwards, yet shaky and subtly sad, to the point where I find myself forgetting to do simple tasks like remembering to close the fridge or keyboard shortcuts that I've been using for years. I can hardly focus on any task that I try doing and I'll always end up with this horrible feeling in my chest too. All of this just adds to the stress. 

I usually try to avoid getting in confrontations with people, which has lead to me not speaking up when I really ought to, and sometimes confrontations are just inevitable even if I try doing everything I can to avoid them. 

I try reminding myself that the confrontation is inconsequential, or that annoying others doesn't determine my self worth. I intensely exercise regularly and sleep well most nights; I even try meditating if the stress is particularly bothersome. None of it helps except waiting it out.

To start off, we live in UK and we have already tried something called ""Talking Therapies"" to no avail the person was deemed not having ""severe enough"" symptoms which to me is a joke and their system is broken anyway it seems. 

So I am desparate to get some advice on how to help somebody that is suffering from a severe anxiety/stress as well as severe OCD that is affecting our life very much on a daily basis and I always feel like there's nothing I can do to help and the helplessness is killing me too at the same time.

This has all been happening ever since I started going to university again (beginning of September) and I've just been really emotional. Firstly I assumed it was because before starting my classes, I had to move apartments, so that was really stressful for me. Then the first week of uni was just awful, lots of heavy subjects and big, important projects to work on thru the year. 

The second week I kept crying every day and I started arguing with my partner a lot(me getting angry/upset about very dumb stuff), I understood that it probably was from all the stress and me being always on the verge so we talked it out and we're okay now (thankfully, he's lovely and great with communication).

But now I just have this intense feeling of anxiety whenever I simply think about university. I had no classes this last week, so it was a nice little break for me, or at least you'd think so. But every day I kept on feeling unproductive, like I SHOULD be working instead of 'lazying around' but the weather's been awful and I've been having lots of headaches and not much quality sleep so I haven't been able to work (I've tried all week as well). I know it should be okay because I've been unwell, but I just can't help but blame myself, 'I should've been doing work' and instead it's already Monday and I've got nothing done. 

I wish I could drop out but it's impossible for me, so all I can do is try to cope and manage a way for me to survive this year.

And I‚Äôm in 3 classes in college so approx. full time academic schedule as well. Well about 2 months ago my husband informed me that he had planned a week off work with pay so we could move. Previously we rented while working on an old trailer. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that when he planned the move the trailer wasn‚Äôt done and still isn‚Äôt. Fast forward 3 weeks and I was only able to get one day off work and excused from one class. Trailer was still an active construction zone, tools everywhere, unused materials laying around, drywall and sawdust, so no i wasn‚Äôt exactly excited to pack everything and actually move. The entire process was a nightmare, my husband and I could game-plan one minute and the next minute he would be on a completely different planet from what we had planned. Over and over and over, and it‚Äôs still happening. Now it‚Äôs 2-3 weeks later and minimal progress has been made as far as the things that need to be done. Example being the bedroom door. We do have a door the only thing we need is hinges and to borrow the tool from his dad (walking distance). Or the hot water heater being moved so we can install a washer and dryer in that space, the main plumbing is done and it‚Äôs pretty much moving it, connecting the plumbing and running wire, we have all the materials needed. If I had time to watch YouTube enough to feel confident doing it myself I would but between work, school, dogs and just regular adulting I‚Äôm doing good maintaining our rate of settling in. My husband works a blue collar job usually anywhere from 40-60 hours a week and I understand he‚Äôs tired when he gets home (his tool bag alone is mega heavy and I lift people for a living). But other than work his only other responsibilities are the bare minimum of house work usually and a few dog walks depending on if I work or not that day. I understand he works hard and is tired but I do too, I‚Äôm trying to become a nurse so I can lighten our financial load so im working as a CNA and have 2 prerequisites left after this semester before I can start the nursing program. On top of my regular schedule I‚Äôve been spending my extra time cleaning and unpacking in different areas which has been difficult due to decreased storage and now have to drive our trash off and currently have to go to the laundromat which is more time consuming. Like the entire process before we officially moved out of the rental, yet again the reality is a million miles away from the game plan. Instead of focusing on the big jobs that I don‚Äôt know how to do and frankly don‚Äôt have time to learn like moving hot water heaters or installing washer and dryer hookups he's worrying about silly things and playing xbox.

65,"Stress-Related Illness, Leave of Absence, Coping with Guilt  I had several panic attacked over the past few weeks including 4 between Friday and Monday.  There are a lot of personal factors involved, but a lot of the stress and anxiety come from work.  

My doctor recommended a leave of absence.   When I showed up in the doctor's office, I was a sobbing mess, my heart rate was in the 130s, and my blood pressure was 170s/90s.  Given my state, I agreed with the doc about the leave of absence, we tried some medication changes, and I'm tip toeing forward. 

The only thing I've communicated to my employer so far is that I need the leave of absence for personal illness and that's been it.  As of this moment right now, I don't think I'll be returning to that job and I'm taking my leave to get away from the work stressors and to job hunt.  

I somehow feel incredibly guilty to use this leave to job hunt.  I don't know why.  I also feel a lot of guilt around not going back to work, etc etc.

68,"Stress increasing because of my parents  Hello community, I've posted about this before as well but I can't seem to overcome it.

My parents constantly fight with each other and it usually gets ugly. My dad is really abusive emotionally as well as physically and I've told my mother multiple times to just leave him. She says that my grandmom will not be able to handle a divorce of her child because my uncle (mom's real brother) had a divorce as well and my grandmother had a lot of pressure regarding what society would say or some crap. 

I have explained to my mother that this is not the kind of relationship you continue but she said a) she can't hurt my grandmother as she might get an attack if she listens to this kind of news. b) we only have one house of her own and my mother has worked her ass off to pay for this house, my dad has also contributed but I mean buying a house is not just putting in the money, you have to set it up as well and there are a lot of legal formalities to be also completed and all of that my mother has done


In my previous post , it was pointed out that it takes two to tango and my mother may also be at fault more often than I know and I totally agree with it. I can understand my father's perspective as well. But he is doing absolutely nothing to control his rage , he is not willing to come halfway at all. He just sits at home all day and whines and complains about what my mother does and doesn't. TBH, he just cannot digest the fact that my mother is the breadwinner of this family and he isn't but he still wants to act important.


You may have guessed it that I hardly respect him in any sense, all of reasoning went out the window when he raised his hand at my mother.I think this fuels his frustration more. 

The point is that I have to control my stress because I have accepted the fact that this is what my mother is choosing to do. i have tried to tell her but she is choosing to stay here. I don't know whether I should step in and stop their fights or just like sit in my room and let it play out

69,"Some Breathing Techniques to reduce Fatique and Stress  **Belly Breathing Technique**  
Known as diaphragmatic breathing, this method is a powerful tool to activate the calming response of the parasympathetic nervous system, the ""rest and digest"" state, according to Bartolucci.  
Interestingly, infants naturally breathe from their bellies, indicating a more efficient oxygen intake method, unlike adults who often resort to less efficient chest breathing. To reclaim this innate ability, Bartolucci suggests:  
\- Opt for a comfortable stance; lying down might be preferable for a greater range of motion.  
\- Gently inhale through the belly for a count of four seconds, allowing the abdomen to expand significantly more than the chest.  
\- Exhale smoothly for at least four seconds.  
\- Aim to incorporate this technique into your daily routine, gradually increasing to five minutes of practice. It‚Äôs also beneficial for immediate relaxation needs.  
\- Bartolucci herself practices and recommends this technique for both personal calmness and patient advice.  
**Coherent Breathing Practice**  
According to Gerbarg, while an average adult's breathing rate is about 15-20 breaths per minute, reducing it to five breaths per minute can significantly enhance relaxation and brain efficiency. This reduction signals to the brain that all is well.  
Gerbarg's recommendations include:  
\- Utilizing a breath pacing app or online guide to assist with breathing cues, allowing you to focus solely on the rhythm of your breath without distraction.  
\- Breathe gently, preferably through the nose, and consider closing your eyes to concentrate inwardly and exclude external interruptions.  
\- Aim for a slow, light breath, letting your belly naturally expand.  
\- Work towards dedicating around 20 minutes daily to this practice. It's also effective for easing anxiety and aiding sleep.  
\- With practice, you can perform this breathing technique discreetly anywhere, even with your eyes open.  
Gerbarg emphasizes, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredibly potent.‚Äù  
**4-7-8 Breathing Exercise**  
This straightforward technique can slow the heart rate and elicit tranquility:  
\- Start by inhaling quietly through the nose for a count of four.  
\- Hold your breath for seven counts.  
\- Exhale through the mouth to a count of eight.  
Dr. Melissa Young, from the Cleveland Clinic, advises engaging in three rounds of this exercise twice daily to establish a regular practice.",Stressed

72,"Stress manifesting crazy physical symptoms  For over a year, I had severe pain in my groin area when working out (24F). I always brushed it off and blamed it on my lack of stretching until I started to get into running. One morning, I was on a short run, when about a mile in I felt shooting pain up and down my leg. 

Long story short, after an X-ray and MRI, it was determined I had an osteoblastoma on my pelvis bone. A bone tumor that occurs in 1% of people. Before the diagnosis, many doctors thought it was cancer and I was truly traumatized by the whole situation. My biopsy was sent to the Mayo Clinic and my scans were passed around to various doctors. Luckily, the surgery to remove it went very well and I was feeling great for about over a year‚Ä¶. working out, running, feeling grateful that this nightmare was over. 

Flash forward to a month ago, I began having pain in that area again. My doctor told me it was most likely a muscle strain and to give it some time. I gave it 2 weeks (stressed as hell) and finally got a script for an MRI. During the week waiting for my MRI, I began peeing a lot. I usually pee when I‚Äôm nervous but this particular weekend I was peeing every hour with bladder pressure. On Monday, I went to urgent care. My urine was negative for a UTI but I was prescribed antibiotics anyway for preventative measures. The antibiotics made me feel horrible (dizzy, nauseous and weak). I stopped taking them after the first day and felt pain in my back. I ended up going to the ER concerned that the infection had gotten worse. The hospital did a CT scan where they told me my kidneys and urinary tract looked fine‚Äî even my bloodwork was perfect! So now I‚Äôm assuming the excessive peeing was a physical symptom of my stress awaiting results. In the CT scan, they were also able to get a view of my pelvis which they did notify me that they see new growth at the surgical site. I was completely devestated because I knew this meant re-living the nightmare I had been through prior. I met with my surgeon later that week who told me reoccurrence was rare but possible and told me my options. Every since meeting with him, I‚Äôve felt dizzy and extremely anxious. I had a panic attack a few days ago and have moments throughout the day where I feel like nothing is real and I‚Äôm going insane. I‚Äôm constantly crying and I‚Äôm scared these feelings won‚Äôt go away. I‚Äôm usually never anxious, excercise, eat healthy and have never had any past medical issues so I‚Äôm concerned.

While I like a generally clean and tidy house, it is specifically the kitchen where I have issues. It has definitely gotten worse over the years and is particularly difficult to maintain when living with others as they are rarely able to live up to this. I live with 2 flatmates currently but have experienced this living elsewhere and with other people so I'm fairly sure that this is a me problem and that my 'standard' is above and beyond the norm. I try to manage this by keeping separate crockery, cutlery, cleaning/tidying thoroughly after someone has used the kitchen etc.

I'm kind of OK trying to practically mitigate this as I see it as a burden for me to bear, but what I really struggle with is my emotions around this. I often find myself anxious when other people are in the kitchen or angry that they are using it. If I do find something 'disgusting' left behind by someone else (it can be as small as some rice left around the hob or the chopping boards left in a way that means they dont dry) I often rage clean in a passive aggressive fashion, sometimes ending with me in tears and feeling like I'm having a breakdown. 

I don't know how to find a way out of this, it's like I have no control in those moments and I really don't like how it makes me feel and act.

Bipolar and Stress don‚Äôt mesh

Part 1 ‚Äì The Effects of Stress 

Oil and water is a great analogy for how well Bipolar disorder meshes with stress. 

Being one that is Bipolar when I experience stress I have increased symptoms of hypomania or depression and which one depends on the kind of stress I run into.  
Not everyone may know that stress is a physical problem that takes a toll on the body.  I've personally experienced a few problems it can cause and I myself call stress the silent killer because I had (Dr not Me) a stress ulcer that had my stomach burning for almost 2 weeks, my toes through my feet up through my ankles were swelling and my bottom lip was covered in fever blisters. (The year prior at 39yrs old without any training I finished 1st in my age group in a 5k run.  I had never experienced anything like what happened to me) During that 14 days I had blood drawn and tested 2 different times but the blood work results comeback saying I was fine, my numbers were good.  So from a doctors standpoint I was healthy with no issues while my body was destroying itself, hence the Silent Killer. 

Stress can effect your mood to your immune system.  And I also learned that people suffering from a mental illness can't handle the amount of stress the average person can.  We struggle making big decisions and the littlest decisions stress us out. So if everyone experiences stress and anxiety from life then that just means that extra stress makes us feel Extra bipolar symptoms. 
Again the symptoms will be hypomania, depression or a mixed episode (state).
Like say if I have a project coming up at work that I've been preparing for I‚Äôll probably be amped up with hypomania but if an unexpected expense come and I'm struggling to pay my mortgage I'm going to be hypomanic mixed with depression until the energy runs out leaving me in a locked in my bedroom state of depression.

I actually obtained the qualification last year and transferred at the beginning of this year to study graphic design.

I then had the idea of returning to the hospitality industry (which I hate) because the director is a friend of my father's and from the same village. After that, I felt a severe depression and a sense of loss because I would be studying something I despise and that I do not find myself in (this is a long story). However, the director told me that I could study something I want in university (except for medicine and law, which I cannot) after obtaining the technical baccalaureate certificate. I relaxed a little on this subject, but the idea that I would be studying something I hate and subjects I hate and repeating the same teachers makes me feel hopeless.

92,"How do you deal with stress from high school?  
I‚Äôm in senior year of high school in China and I hate my school life for so long that I must say something about it.
High schools in China are nothing but tension. At school we get up at 6 am and go back to the dormitory and go to bed at 11 pm, 6 days every week. During the 17 hour awake, 90% of the time all we have are just endless courses, endless tests and endless homework. That‚Äôs the normal schedule. Personally, I often stay up until 12:30 am because I‚Äôm afraid that I can‚Äôt finish my assignments in time and get left behind in my courses. Why do we have so many assignments? Maybe that‚Äôs because of our six subjects: Chinese, math, English, physics, chemistry and biology. (The last three vary according to your choice. ) For each subject all we do is just learning massive knowledge and do endless exercises, just in effort to get higher grades in exams. What is in exams is what they teach and we learn. If something doesn‚Äôt appear in exams, it is not important. This is how they define ‚Äúimportance‚Äù for what we learn. I came to accept the sad fact that high schools are not for learning anything new and not for curiosity; they are just tools to train you for Gaokao (Chinese college entrance examination), and Gaokao is just a tool for filtering out students with less ability to adapt to the law of the jungle, so that universities will have ‚Äúhigh-quality student source‚Äù. I really hate the term ‚Äústudent source‚Äù which is so commonly used by our teachers and universities. It gives me a sense that students are not considered as individuals but as a kind of ‚Äúresource‚Äù for universities, followed by companies, to exploit. The higher grades students of a high school get in Gaokao, the more compliments (and bonus maybe) the school gets from the local government and people, so I think that‚Äôs one of the reasons why most high schools in China apply so much pressure on their students. 
So I hate high school. I hate all the endless courses, endless tests and endless assignments. I hate staying in the classroom all day long. I hate the way they teach things. I hate the belief (BE POSITIVE! BE HARD-WORKING!) they are trying to stuff our heads with. I hate not being allowed to pursue things I‚Äôm passionate about because my endless tests and assignments have taken up 95% of my time. I once signed up for a sketch course and a programming course as extra-curriculum but gave them up after three days because that made me unable to finish all the math homework in time. I used to suppress my disgust of all these and force myself to eat up the piece of something but that only got me a depression that I suffered for half a year (I have recovered, but I‚Äôm still disgusted with high school) To keep us ‚Äúlearn‚Äù and ‚Äúdo homework‚Äù, they even try to dominate our time during winter and summer holidays, never giving up to claim that ‚ÄúHOLIDAY IS THE BEST TIME TO EXCEED OTHERS IN GRADES‚Äù, forcing us to install an online meeting app on our phones, forcing us to turn on the front camera to monitor us to make sure that we are ‚Äústudying‚Äù, not allowing us to do anything else, asking us to upload our assignments everyday, as we do at school, from day to night, because they believe and never stop making us believe that ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT ATTEMPT TO ENJOY HOLIDAY. YOUR HOME IS JUST A DIFFERENT PLACE FOR STUDYING‚Äù. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve just gone through over the past 3-week winter holiday.
There is a common belief among Chinese people: ‚ÄúA GOOD UNIVERSITY ENSURES A GOOD-PAID JOB‚Äù. But that belief seems to lose its status in recent years. Allegedly 90% (I don‚Äôt have accurate statistics, but information I got makes me believe it) students with only a bachelor‚Äôs degree are unable to get a job, forcing them to compete for graduate programs, making the competition even more intense than Gaokao. Even though you get a job at a company, you‚Äôll be tired of tight schedules and a low pay that is not enough to cover the price of a medium-sized apartment in many big cities. This kind of intense social competition may have contributed to the decline in China‚Äôs population and my worries about my future. News of students‚Äô suicide was reported every year, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to bring any changes and the deceased students were blamed ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù by some adults.
During those meeting days I was so tired of homework that every time when a meeting ended, I‚Äôd indulge in endless scrolling, watching silly short videos to get a brief moment of excitement, meanwhile feeling a kind of guilt and concern that if I don‚Äôt work hard, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to be admitted into a good university, but I just couldn‚Äôt stop scrolling and had no desire to study at all. I also wanted to pick up my long-deserted hobby of drawing and programming during the holiday but it only made me feel that I was wasting my time. But I didn‚Äôt want to calm down to study, either. This conflict kept occupying my mind everyday, and until now, I have unconsciously concluded that I completed nothing during the holiday. But isn‚Äôt holiday for relaxing? Why was I asking myself to work hard and achieve something and even make a ‚Äúholiday plan‚Äù previously? Am I unconsciously changed by the belief I always hated? What should I do?

94,"Sudden visitors stress me out so much ( venting + help needed)   I've come here for some advice regarding following topic (and tbh to vent a little)
First, I'm diagnosed social anxiety, depression and borderline - traits. I'm having a Job - so that takes a lot of my limited energy. 

I'm living in the same house as my parents. The door isn't locked at daytime and visitors, such as my siblings and their kids can come in without asking.
And I'm so, so incredibly stressed out by this. 
I'm managing my energy every day and it's hard. Things I can't control throw me off big time, especially when someone nerve consuming as my niece is coming. (She's not to blame for being a kid; but she constanly talks and talks, stands in your way. You can't even go taking a shit without being a target. She's not following rules and then a fight between my sister and my parents starts 8 of 10 times. I'm not good with kids in general though)

Not having the best relationship with my sisters either. So as soon as they arrive my symptoms rise high. I first feel instant rage within me,  I withdraw from the situation and then fall in a depressed mood until they leave. Like, just sitting here quiet and waiting. I'm not even 100% 'safe' in my private rooms, I guess privacy isn't existing much for my family. I tested out asking if they could at least ask beforehand or shoot a message before driving here but all I get is: ""it's Not YOUR House"" ""but I'm visiting OUR PARENTS""  and tbh I can't even explain why all this is happening and what I want. I don't understand myself. 

Why am I like this?? I need strategies so much, 'unwanted' visitors come in every other day. ( I'm fine when my aunt visits tho). Please share if you have any ideas ‚ù§Ô∏è

99,"Stress and suffering  The overwhelming source of conditions deemed to be mental health is the result of stress. Stress is the difference between our expectations and how ""things"" really are. Suffering occurs when we repeatedly experience the same stress. Consider stress to be the equivalent of hitting yourself in the head once. Suffering is when you repeatedly hit yourself in the head.

Stress is our teacher. It is bringing us a message about ourselves that we need to become aware of and surrender the belief that is promoting the unwanted condition that becomes diagnosable as a mental illness. Healing requires that we learn to use the tool of awareness to accomplish the task.

We all have awareness but we have unevenly learned to value and use awareness as the healing tool that it is. Awareness is like a hammer, the most simple tool imaginable, but if you've never seen a hammer, it likely will take a few minutes for you to learn to use it properly. Once you have learned what the function of the hammer is, you will need to practice using it, but, with practice, you will soon be building entire houses with the same simple tool.

These past two years, my life has fallen apart, and I am struggle to find the motivation to improve myself. During my senior year of high school, my best friend and I grew apart after doing our junior year online due to Covid. It sucked because they were my only friend and without them, I was alone. On top of that, I was struggling to stay motivated in school and was stressed out a lot.

Fast forward to freshman year of college, things were going fine initially. I was doing fine in my classes, but struggled to make friends. Then, the coursework ended up multiplying and it lead to me having a mental breakdown and then taking a leave of absence. I also had the same outcome back in the Fall of 2023. Ultimately, I dropped out of college because I figured out it wasn‚Äôt for me.

Thus, now I am trying to figure my life out. I have been working at a family business for the past two years but hate it. I only took the job because I wanted to figure out what other options I had. I did find a career path that I am interested in, which involves animals. However, I still continue to suffer from depression and feel like a waste of space.

Lately, I have been reminiscing about high school, and my old friendship. I used to be a promising student and had a small social circle. However, I have fallen so far since and am a failure. I have failed my family as a daughter and feel like an embarrassment. I have always had trouble making friends and feel unworthy. On top of that, I made a big mistake yesterday while driving that is killing me. For me, driving is a way to establish independence, but I feel like such an idiot. 

Today, I had bad anxiety thinking about what could come of my mistake, as I am unsure if I would receive a ticket or not. During my anxiety attack, my parents told me that I stress them out, and they‚Äôre right. I am a huge burden to everyone around me and sometimes, I feel like they would be better off without me. I have dealt with severe mental health issues since middle school, and they have faced more challenges with me. My brother also had his own struggles, but nothing compared to me. He is successful, has plans for his life, a girlfriend, and happiness. I feel like the defective child. Honestly, the thought of suicide just crosses my mind sometimes. I hate that I exist.

I get very anxious and stressed, also derealization, but no sweating or similar things that happen with panic attacks  
Hey reddit  
Over the last couple of weeks, I've been having some type of panic or stress attacks. It's a weird feeling, it often happens when I'm sitting somewhere that I can't really ""escape"" from, for example, I had one a few weeks ago at my great grandmothers funeral, and I had one when I was seeing a movie in the theatres with my school. I get really scared and anxious for some reason, but I don't have any  other symptoms of panic attacks like sweating or something similar. I just feel super scared of nothing in particular, maybe some sort of claustrophobia, although I didn't really have any claustrophobia before this. I also have derealization when this happens. It al started around 2 months ago, when I was sitting in biology class and one of my classmates went into a sort of epileptic shock or something similar, where he sort of passed out and wasn't in control over his body. When he woke up he said it was because he was thinking of something really graphic in his head (we were learning about pregnancy and child birth and there were a lot of really bad pictures). Ever since then, I became super scared of having the same thing happen to me, and every biology class really became a battle, with me trying to stay calm. Luckily, after a few weeks we began a different subject, and those moments were over. But then it started happening outside of class, whenever I was sitting down and couldn't ""get out"", at the funeral for example, but also yesterday when I was attending a college introduction seminar with my dad. There are also some things in my personal life going on right now that definitely don't have a good impact on my mental health, but I don't really think that they are related. I hope that someone can give me some advice or a diagnosis of some sorts, because I really don't know what to do. The more they happen, the more I think about them and the moment the thought crosses my mind that I could one of these ""attacks"" later, I'm fucked.

First time posting here I think. Context: both of us are in our 20s.

I need some help and advice. To preface: I've just asked my work/studying about getting therapy for myself again, as I think I need some extra help. I work/study in a high stress, high emotionally draining field, and am training which is high stress. I've been off ill for 2 months after a surgery, which now means my training will be delayed/extended further than I'd hoped. I am the main breadwinner, and my partner helps by paying money towards expenses (they are lower earner than me). 

The problem: 

My partner hates their job, it's making them ill, physically and psychologically, and I feel so helpless. They've been trying to find an alternative job for ages, but due to issues, a lot of jobs are off the table, and they say they are stuck doing the awful minimum wage dead-end jobs that makes them feel suicidal. I'm trying to look into options, but I'm also swamped with work, still recovering, and keep being ill/stressed. 
They do night shifts, are trying to find a day shift job, but its so hard. They recently had to turn down an opportunity that they'd have thoroughly enjoyed because we were unable to afford it on just my wage and with our expenses. I feel/felt awful, and like an awful partner for saying no, and for miscommunication where I made them feel I'd decided for them (we've talked about it and I honestly can't apologise enough, I feel just terrible, because I know that this opportunity was the only thing they say they were looking forward to). 

I know Reddit usually gives unhelpful/superficial advice (or has from what I've seen in the past), but I am just desperate to help and get us both feeling overall better and more content. I feel so stuck with this, they feel so stuck in their job, and I hate how in pain they are.

* chewing gum
* working in different rooms
* putting my phone in other rooms
* working in my back garden

I had a panic attack earlier today because my boss asked me to something that I ignored for about 4 hours before he asked for a progress update, I then found out that I didn't have the right access so I had to bullshit my way through some excuse to not get him to be angry with me.

I feel so bad about it all but I just don't understand why I can't function properly when I'm at home I hate it. I feel so motivated every day to work because I love what I do but I just cant bring my self to ACTUALLY do any of the work that I'm so motivated to do.

129,"Stress after emotional affair  So it all began a few weeks ago when I discovered my wife had lied to me about who she was talking to on Snapchat. She had initially said it was my sister, after I disproved that she lied again and I only found about it on Monday. She was laid off from work and began streaming on Twitch. I had my concerns she would connect with someone on that platform, and she did. From the little I saw before she got her phone back to me, she was sending seductive pictures, daily and telling this person how she loved them and the support they were providing her. When she was laid off I told her she didn‚Äôt have to rush back into anything and to take the time to relax, recoup or whatever so I thought I was being supportive. After discovering all this from actually more than one guy (2 initially) I was pretty upset. I made sure she knew how upset I was but it seemed like a fairly new thing, and she was in a stressful situation so I told her that we could really give it a shot at working through it and we went to bed. 

The next day, I went to work and texted her good morning, and how I had wished all this was a dream, blah blah blah. She responded ‚ÄúIt will be over soon‚Äù and that sat very uncomfortably with me. I was able to leave work and come home, and when I did I asked her if we could talk. We began talking and I immediately noticed something was VERY off. She was struggling to talk without slurring her speech, she couldn‚Äôt stand up strait and could hardly walk. Now she also has her own myriad of issues so she has plenty of prescriptions on hand, so I asked her what she took. She wouldn‚Äôt give me a strait answer so after some very ineligible back and forth with her I decided to call an ambulance. While talking to the dispatcher he asked me if I thought this was a suicide attempt, so I asked her bluntly if it was. She responded, ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. 

We can fast forward to her now at the BHU, and me having access to her phone, and to spare the detail‚Äôs I discovered this patter of infidelities spanned back to 2020, with at least 4 separate guys. I was thrown strait onto the warpath. I had a separation agreement drafted, got ahold of a lawyer and started making the arrangements to send her down the road. I also had the displeasure of having to tell her parents and brother about what had transpired to this point, and I made sure they knew what I was planning to do. They pleaded and tried to get me to see reason and make an effort to still try and save our marriage even if it was only for our 5 year old daughter. I told them I know what it‚Äôs like growing up with parents who resent each other and I don‚Äôt want that for my daughter to which they wound up apprehensively agreeing with me. 

So I tapped my support circle and told them everything, and they supported me in my effort to begin the separation process. After a night of shitty sleep, a very hard workout, a 10 mile ruck and an ice bath I started to look at her pattern of behavior differently, could this be her addiction? Could these guys be her vice and she needs this validation and affection to give her a dopamine spike? Can she even help it? That‚Äôs when I began to reconsider the separation and maybe help her help herself so we could maybe build something stronger than we initially had, decided that‚Äôs what I was going to do and than I called her and told her this to try and give her a glimmer of hope while she was in the BHU. This is on Thursday, mid morning. 

Now (Friday) I am pretty resolved in this decision, and I picked her up from the BHU around 12:30. I got her home, made sure she had a soft and safe place to land and we had some good talks, good physical affection (no sex, just hugs, kisses and so forth) and a nice dinner together as a family. She‚Äôs expressed her remorse and apologized, a lot. I think it‚Äôs important to mention that I told her, that I am willing to trust her again but it‚Äôll be subject to verification (is that even trust?). We laid in bed and watched some TV, talked and than it was time to turn it off and go to sleep. As I laid there I looked up and saw the light from her phone screen illuminating the ceiling, and when I rolled over it looked all the same as it did when I first saw her messaging the person from SnapChat.

I‚Äôm downstairs now, I can‚Äôt sleep, I thought this resolution would help this ‚Äútrauma‚Äù if I can call it that but now I feel more confused and scared than ever. What do I do? 

Note, she has outpatient therapy everyday next week, I‚Äôve got counseling on Wednesday through my companies EAP, and we begin marriage counseling on Friday the 28th, I‚Äôm still resolved in my decision but it‚Äôs going to be A LOT tougher than I originally thought, I don‚Äôt even know if I can sleep in the bed with her for the time being. 

Thanks in advance.

132,"We have a switch inside our physical body to counteract stress.  It goes unnoticed, is unknowingly activated daily by most for other reasons.  


  
What does inspiring movie scenes, songs that move us or just human interaction with loved ones all have in common? They activate this powerful blissful energy inside of us that is commonly known as Frisson, Euphoria, Prana, Qi and can be most easily felt within us when we experience chills/goosebumps from positive events/stimuli.  


  
This soothing energy can be learned to be activated as you please without any outside stimuli, just the simple intention of experiencing it. So imagine how helpful it can be when faced with unwanted stress/anxiety. You can even feel it over your whole body, flooding your being with its natural ecstasy and master it to the point of controlling its duration.  


  
This has been documented, many years ago, in the eastern part of the world as they discovered that it can be made to flow through the body via channels coined as Meridians or Nadis that encompass the entire human body.  


  
It has been researched and documented under many names like Bioelectricity, Life force, Prana, Chi, Qi, Orgone, Rapture, Tension, Aura, Euphoria, Ecstasy, Mana, Vayus, ASMR, Nen, Intent, Tummo, Odic force, Kriyas, Pitƒ´, Frisson, Ruah, Spiritual Energy, Secret Fire, The Tingles, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Aether, Chills, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.   


  
Why is this important? Too many sources point us to outside substances to manage stress, as if the human body wasn't designed to be able to rely on itself for its own internal problems.  


  
Now for some of you that say that stress is good should consider that there are two types of stress and oxidative stress has been linked to several neurological diseases (i.e., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis, depression, and memory loss). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2724665/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2724665/)  


  
If you are interested in using your ''Frisson switch'', here are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) going more in-depth on how to control your energy and to understand where it comes from.

I am always stressed, sometimes feels like the meds don't help, the counseling doesn't help, the methods taught by my therapist doesn't help. I constantly feel like I am never good enough, the house is never going to be good enough, I can't get the kids Ina comfortable safe environment.

Most of my stress comes from everything else but the kids, they just set it off. I finally calm down try to chill and bam, they start things up, or the pre-teen wants to fight about something random with me because of their pre-teen hormones. 

The real stress is a economy,  the house we are stuck in, the finicial mess we are in. The money issues are because all the right events happening in a row and just start to recover from it. I love my family, the wife sometimes crowds me when I need my alone time to processes my stress. She can very clingy at times, then the oppisite. She is having help as well. 

Sometimes my wife stress shops, which never helps the problem. Sometimes it's not stress shopping it's impulse shopping. Then lies and tries to hide it, I am worried it's because of how upset I get. Anger management was something I never wanted to need, now I have it. I didn't want to be like my father. Now I am, only difference is I don't do drugs/alcohol to self medicate bipolar depression. 

I went from contemplating arson/insurance fraud on the monthly regular in hopes of having the house replaced by the insurance company.  To now almost never so I guess that's the silver lining.",Stressed
152,"Schizophrenia or stress induced psychosis?  My brother is currently in an in patient treatment center. This is his second ‚Äúbreak from reality‚Äù. The first time was about 8 years ago with no other signs or symptoms in between. The first time he was about 19 or 20 and had just left home. He was given a promotion to a management role at Jimmy Johns and was working a lot of hours and under a lot of stress. Eventually he disappeared for a day or two, then ended up in a hospital in another state. He was having paranoid delusions and hallucinations. He was also hyper focused on finding ‚Äúa deeper meaning‚Äù in many things. He stayed about a week at an inpatient facility, was put on Latuda and release when he had mostly returned to normal. For a time after he was not 100% back to normal. He would ask odd questions and hyper focus on certain things, especially ‚Äúdeeper meanings‚Äù, but after several months there were no signs that anything had occurred at all. 
Fast forward to now. My brother again has been promoted to a managerial role, he has been working many hours, was supposed to get married in a couple weeks and a lady that was our neighbor growing up, and he looked at as a grandmother passed away last week. 
Several days ago my brothers fianc√©e called me to let me know he had been admitted to an inpatient facility with many of the same delusions, and hallucinations. He had also not slept in 3 or 4 days and wasn‚Äôt eating. He is making progress, but has agreed to stay at least a week again.

I promised myself that after primary school, I am going to never be with someone who is controlling towards me and toxic. I don't have any school friends even 7 years later.

162,"Stress Management?  I've been stressed, probably since birth but recently its become much more of a problem. I feel completely spent physically, mentally and emotionally. Normally, I just suck it up and deal with it until it goes away, but now I have four kids and I can't let myself do that anymore. Here's some details on how I function:

\- Traumatic childhood, and various mental health issues probably stemming from it. Never been to therapy, and I'm sure that's going to be a recommendation. It is on the agenda. Previous psychs have diagnosed me with depression, PTSD, disassociation disorder, and a few other ones but that was over a decade ago when I was barely a teenager. I never did anything about those, just swallowed it and pretended like I was above it. 

\- Wife is worse than I am, so I cant lean on her for help because were in the same boat. (And yes we had four kids, not the most logical move, but it is what it is and wouldn't change a thing). She has a hard time keeping up with everything, so I constantly pick up the slack which kind of weighs down on me a little bit. She cant get into that ""push through it"" mentality, while I've desensitized myself to it, so for me, it makes dealing with it easier. 

\- Full time worker, almost full time student, and full time dad. I get the kids ready for school every morning, go to work, come home, immediately cook dinner (half the time), and then get them all in bed, every day. Therefore, extra time is nonexistent. 

\- Constantly feel overwhelmed, overstimulated, fatigued, and I seem to react to things faster than my brain can process them, leading to me barking at the kids for stupid shit, for example. 

\- I'm not active and I'm not social (never have been). I do plan on being more active, but I cant bring myself to do it now because I can't bear adding anything else to my plate. Same applies to mindfulness/meditation. 

\- Diet is poor. No breakfast, usually no lunch, sometimes dinner, big night time snacker. 

\- I hold myself to an extremely high standard, and I criticize myself, pretty harshly, for falling short. Problem is that its hard to meet that standard under this kind of duress, so its a brutal cycle. 

\- I started taking ashwagandha, but haven't noticed much of a difference. The constant stress makes sleeping, or staying asleep, virtually impossible, so I smoke different THC/CBD products (like 3 different vapes that have Delta 8/9/10, CBD, etc.) every night right before I go to sleep (cause of the nighttime snacks). That helps a bunch, but I don't do it during the day, because kids and responsibilities. 

\- Current cause of stress is financial, but that will sort itself out over the next week or two. These stress episodes come a few times a year and I just want to be prepared for next time. 

It has reached the point where I can no longer hide it from the kids. They can see it and feel it. I can feel the trauma from my childhood cracking through the vault that its been locked in forever. Oddly enough, I'm numb to the trauma. I've always told myself, even as a kid, that it didn't bother me. My siblings can recount specific incidents and how it made them feel and such, but when I recount them, I feel completely emotionless, which is why I've always been reluctant on therapy (that and pushing antidepressants, parents were addicts and I don't want to take them). I have no concern over my own well being, I only care about making sure I can support and develop my kids in the best way possible, but now I'm realizing that I can't do that without addressing my own issues. I'm becoming a lot more conscious about the mental aspect of things, and the residual effects of everything I say and do. My oldest is 8 and she already exhibits signs of anxiety, and I cant help but blame myself for it, so I have to sort this out as quickly as possible. 

Its hard to make sense of it, or explain it, so I hope any of that made sense. You guys have any tips on how you personally manage stress? Recommendations on what to tackle first? Opinions on therapy? I don't even know where to start lol.",Stressed
163,"Stress/OCD  I need advice. When I was about 11 years old, I had a girlfriend. I know, I was very young. The girl was about 15 years old. The problem, however, arose when a 20-year-old boy showed interest in her. He was kind of the junkie. Drugs, fights, just a wannabe tough guy. And because he want her. He started threatening me, waiting for her outside the school, etc. I was very scared. He wrote to me on Facebook that he was going to beat me. He was sending me messages from friends about how he was going to kill me. since I was young you can't imagine how much fear I was. This lasted about a year. Several times I fell ill directly out of fear. Temperature, headache, vomiting. All out of fear.

So it left quite serious problems for me. Today I am 25 years old, and I feel that the psychological problems that I have are related to this case from childhood. I have tics, I have a set number, and if I don't do it four times, I'll be stressed. I blink a lot to suppress stress, which is really permanent. Every day, every minute, I have negative thoughts. Sometimes it seems to me that it's not even me anymore. The only thing that helps me is my work. I'd rather not say where they work but I help people and it gives me confidence. Anyway, does anyone have any idea what this disease could be? Tics, twitching of the head, very frequent blinking, permanent stress, the feeling that I am no longer me. I used to go to a psychiatrist and he diagnosed me with OCD and depression, but once I started searching the internet to be interested in these diseases, it wasn't quite what I had.

I think I have a problem with work

It‚Äôs gotten worse in the last few week, I have trouble getting out of bed to connect to work, my motivation is not there

And even then in the evening all I do is think about work while watching tv but nothing is productive, it‚Äôs not as much as think as stress about it

I started eating/munching much more in the last few week, no motivation to work out, I basicly lost the last 3 month of discipline i work hard for in less than 1 month

I think the source is a coworker from another teams

His attitude can be summarized as toxic, if you don‚Äôt agree with him or don‚Äôt do what he want he go over your head and get the big boss involved because he is friend with him, I always evaded him and was able to keep him out of my project 

Well he undermined the 3 project I was working on, including one that was nearly finished and now we have a lot of set back in it and have to change scope however direction is not truly given, he did that because I didn‚Äôt do what he wanted, I did listen to his idea, but it wasn‚Äôt the right time to do it, we had more pressing concern but we could have done it in phase 2

Now he‚Äôs done that to my 3 project, indirectly said that the work we did wasn‚Äôt good even if I had high praises the week before from my manager

However today, my toxic colleague not directly but indirectly again indicated that the work we did was useless and my manager who was on the meeting said nothing

Soo now today and the last few week I do nothing in the evening except stress,

I‚Äôm still able to go out with friend and take my mind off work but only if I‚Äôm not alone

I was going to use the program we have at work to help with personal issue, we can get access to professional ressource through it

But as I am sitting on the couch thinking about it, I‚Äôm wondering what do I tell them and how could they help

The last thing I want is to be put on leave at work I still want to make sure my project land ok and If I leave it will just leave a blank for my colleague to destroy or take credit for the work I have been doing for close to a year and a half to land those project

I'm 25M.

\- I have some kind of phone call anxiety, I need to build a lot of mental courage to make a phone call even for simple tasks.

\- I'm quite bad at managing my health. Self-care to start, I'm quite terrible at brushing my teeth. I do work from home most days. Also I'm always putting off going to the gym. I'll go once, then stop for some months. I'm quite horrible with my diet too, but for that I think just proper budgeting and stopping food deliveries will, as a side-effect, go a long way to fix my weight issue.

\- I'm very anxious about my job. I get what feels like very little feedback from my managers. Just some feedback from co-workers, many of them it just seems like they don't know what they're talking about tho. I basically get performance anxiety, I could be a stellar employee but if I don't get frequent feedback about it it just feels like I could be fired next week. Also an important part of this is my time management. I don't like to wake up and go to work early, so for the office days I'll either be like 20-30 minutes late or I'll just work from home in the morning and show up in the office during lunch break. Performance-wise this is not affecting me but I think other co-workers can get jealous that I'm getting some kind of special treatment.

182,"3 strategies to cope with stress during life transitions  Going through a life transition can be stressful and overwhelming, especially if you have multiple responsibilities for family, work, community, and more. Balancing all these aspects while finding time for self-care can be challenging.

  
  
To better manage your stress, it is essential to improve your time management. In terms of time allocation, I encourage you to begin by addressing your distractions. Take a moment to reflect on the distractions that may be hindering your progress in life. Identify them and consider how you can let go of these distractions. This becomes particularly crucial during times of significant life changes when your old routines or patterns have been disrupted. Prioritize by focusing on one task at a time. Determine what is most important at the moment and let go of less urgent matters.

  
  
The second key strategy is to establish a daily routine for self-care, even if it is as short as 30, 20, or 10 minutes. Dedicate this time to activities that bring you peace and calm, such as reading, journaling, nature walks, yoga, or meditation. Consistently follow this routine daily to recharge. Taking breaks and slowing down can enhance long-term efficiency and productivity.

  
  
**Stress is not solely a result of our actions; it is also influenced by our thoughts. Overthinking can lead to stress and feeling overwhelmed. One effective method to reduce stress is to reframe your thoughts and let go of overthinking.** Practice mindfulness by focusing on the present moment, avoiding worries about the future, or dwelling on the past. When you catch yourself contemplating the past or future, pause, become aware of those thoughts, and redirect your focus to the present moment. Being mindful of everything around you and expressing gratitude.

  
  
**Stress can be a signal that it‚Äôs time to let go ‚Äî let go of distractions, unimportant matters, and negative thoughts. By releasing these attachments, you create space for your mind to rest and quiet down, breaking free from the captivity of stress.** Letting go makes you feel lighter and more liberated.

185,"My brain is addicted to stress and it's destroying me  This has been going on for three years at this point and I'm so tired. It's like I can never catch a break, literally, because every time I relax a bit, my brain gets antsy and needs more stress. I hate it, I can't enjoy or do anything anymore. It has taken so many things I hold dear and completely destroyed them for me. I'm trying so hard to hold on but it's so hard, I just wish I could enjoy things without constantly worrying and being stressed.

It's so difficult to reason with my brain because it just doesn't want to listen to common sense. I just keep repeating the same things over and over again but I still feel like I get worse with time. I just want to live, I don't want to go through this over and over again. I don't want my brain to force me to stop with hobbies just because it's decided to ruin them for me.

It usually starts with my brain wondering if I still like something, even when I'm still really enjoying it, and somehow it convinces my brain that I must not like it anymore. I've had times where I got distracted by something more stressful and it's repaired itself so that makes me doubt that my brain is telling the truth, but I don't know how to prevent it from happening and I'm so tired. I used to just fade out of interests and get sucked into others, but now I feel like I'm holding on even more just because I feel like my dislike for it is caused by my brain and not actually what I feel like.

I know I should get therapy, but I have so much going on and I just don't have time. I also don't have the money for it and I don't think my parents would pay for it since one of them doesn't even believe it works. I feel so lost.

We make a conscious effort to try to get him to relax and be a kid, but I think he suppresses his emotions, and then he has random outbursts of crying because of it IMO from bottling it up. He also has a hard time discussing things. First one being his school day, and after attending his parent teacher conference and learning everything he has to learn through out the day, it's no wonder he's exhausted. We also try to sit down and have engaging conversations about how he feels, how it's okay to feel certain things, but he doesn't want to get into it. I've had lifelong issues with anxiety and trauma and therefore spent most of my childhood in therapy because of it, and still am. I see so much of myself in him.

I'd like to think therapy might help him relax and learn to be okay with exhibiting his emotions and get him to open up. But with his reluctance to discuss things I'm also afraid it might make things worse maybe?

199,"Years of Extreme Stress now Suffering from Physical Anxiety. What can I do?  Hello,

Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to get my story out there so I might be able to get the most beneficial help. 

I am 28M and located in the US. I don't do drugs, don't smoke, and occasionally drink on the weekend. I don't have any history of mental health issues prior to this and I have been suffering non stop now for about 1.5 years. I have been in therapy now for 15 months and my symptoms haven't really changed much unfortunately. 

The reason I ended up here starts in 2020. In the beginning of the year prior to the lock downs, I had my first ever health scare. I had a mole that was looked at by 5 different doctors because it looked identical to melanoma. This freaked me out as my mother passed away from cancer young and I was worried I'd meet the same fate. Luckily it was a super rare benign mole. That was my first experience with physical symptoms. 

Fast forward later in 2020 and I found out my father was going to be losing his job he worked at for 22 years. This started the major stress I feel even to this day because I knew that he would probably never find a job like that that would pay as much as he was making. It scared me so badly that I had my first ever panic attack in September 2020 which I went to the ER for. Then sometime shortly after losing his job, he developed a gambling addiction as my state legalized online gambling. During this time he kept it a secret from the family, but essentially he gambled away his entire severance package and 401k. (Lost close to $115,000). 

Following this he came to me freaking out because he was unemployed and overdrawn his bank account by $8,000 and had some  unemployment money coming in, but couldn't pay his bills. Obviously I broke down because now the situation went from worse to extremely bad. I helped him out. During this time I functioned normal and had no anxiety symptoms despite my finances taking a huge hit. 

He was unemployed the entire 2021 year and did a second gambling wave in the fall. He found a line of credit and gambled away all $22,000 of it. I told him I couldn't help him unfortunately and this created more stress for me as I was so worried he was going to hurt or kill himself I didn't sleep at night for many weeks following this. 

It took him almost 15 months to get a new job after applying to 120ish jobs. He was in a bad spot as he was a senior manager with no college degree and no company wanted him without a degree. Luckily he found a job in early 2022.

Right before taking the job in 2022 my grandmother passed away. I think it was most likely due to the stress he put her under with the unemployment issues. Part of me thinks she OD'd on her medication, but there wasn't an autopsy performed so I'll never know for sure. 

In July 2022 he was fired from his new job because the company wasn't reaching it's job targets. This stressed me out because now 2 years later he is back in the same boat. He ended up getting depressed again and gambled away my grandmother's entire estate that was supposed to support him until he found another job. He gambled the entire estate away over 4 days with the online casinos. (~$90,000) I didn't even know about this until he asked me to get a few things from the store for him and his cards all declined. (More on this later) Even then I still didn't have physical anxiety symptoms. 

**This next part is important because this is where my symptoms start getting really bad**

In October of that year my brother ended up in a bad situation and wrecked his new truck. He was arrested and charged with DUI and Drug Possession. (Never thought that would happen) This caused me so much stress and anxiety that a week later all of my current symptoms start. For 4 days following his arrest I had nightmares about what had happened. About 5 days after finding out I woke up and felt like I was spaced out and drunk. All day it felt like I was going to die at any second. I've never felt like this before. I ended up at my PCPs office 3x in the next week because of how bad I felt. I ended up developing severe health anxiety because I legit thought (and even until this day) something is wrong with me. 

(Getting back to the estate money) Following this all my symptoms are still going on daily, my dad is still unemployed, and my brother was going through his legal troubles this is where I found out my father had gambled my grandmothers estate away. He asked me to talk with him and said ""please don't hate me, buy my bank account is overdrawn by $15,000  and I haven't paid my bills in 2 months."" 

This only made me feel worse and I helped him one last time. I took out a $35,000 personal loan to help him pay his bills because I was extremely embarrassed that he was still gambling and I didn't want anyone to find out that he was going to lose the house. 

Luckily in early 2023 he found a new job and is still there making good money but unfortunately I am still struggling. He also finally got on the 1-800-Gambler list. 

I am at the point now that I lost my job of 8 years because I couldn't perform it anymore because everyday I feel like I am dying with the drunk feeling and shaking. I couldn't even answer basic questions anymore. My dad gets angry at me for being this way and tells me ""it's not my fault you feel that way so don't blame me or your brother."" 

I am currently living off the $40,000 I saved up for a house down payment while I try to get my life back together. I have been in therapy now for 15 months doing both CBT and EMDR without any luck. The symptoms still persist. I know it's anxiety because when I drink it goes away, but everything is now so automatic in my body I can't stop them. I don't even actively think about any of this and I still feel like I'm going to panic. Even a weird bodily sensation can cause me a great deal of distress.  It's hard to talk about all of this without crying and even my therapist starts to cry as well. 

In 2019 I was on top of the world with no anxiety and now I'm a piece of a shell of who I was with no idea how to fix it.

I really don't want to go on medications and would like to know what would you recommend to help me get better from your view as a therapist? Thank you for reading this.

219,"baseball anxiety  Baseball has recently made me so depressed to the point where i can‚Äôt even function and live my life. i‚Äôve played baseball since i was a child and dedicated a pretty big chunk of my life to training. i got pretty good at pitching which allowed me to commit to a D1 college for baseball this winter (my high school senior year). pitching is naturally a very extroverted position as the center of attention is mostly on you and a lot of times, the outcome of the game is dependent on the pitcher. me being introverted, and always suffered from anxiety / performance anxiety hasn‚Äôt been the best in combination with being a pitcher. the added pressure in game makes me fall apart. once i get through the pressure, i do well. but so far only 2 out of my 4 starts have been good this spring varsity season and i keep feeling like i‚Äôm letting my team down whenever i perform bad. after a bad performance, i feel so embarrassed to even show my face after. not rlly sure what to do as i dedicated most of my life to this sport however it gives me so much stress in return to the point where i can‚Äôt be happy",Stressed

224,"Crippling anxiety    
Hello,  
  
Right now I'm sitting (33M), listening to The Teskey Brothers, and crying. I'm crying because I'm going through a very difficult anxiety attack, which prompted me to write this post, which probably won't be seen by many people, but that's okay.  
  
I am an introverted person who has struggled with anxiety all my life, but a year ago my now ex-girlfriend broke up with me after an 8-year relationship. She was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (and several other disorders) at the same time, and the breakup wasn't because of a lack of love or infidelity, but because she couldn't commit to our relationship until she learned to control her issues, and she didn't want to drag me through that anymore (due to several major life changes, all of it came to the surface). I understand her decision because I won't lie, it was extremely difficult to understand what was happening with us.  
  
It's been a year since all that, but I still haven't recovered, not even close. My anxiety has reached a point where it paralyzes me, I can't even perform the simplest tasks at work, and all I can do is curl up in a ball and wait for it to pass. This phase can last for several days, then I'll be okay. And so it goes on.  
  
I grew up in a happy family, but these things were never talked about, so I never learned how to interpret my emotions, let alone verbalize them. This was one of the issues in the relationship. I went to a psychologist for a few months, but in the end, I felt like we were just going around in circles and I didn't learn how to deal with all of this. Maybe I just didn't click with the psychologist.  
  
I'm writing this as a form of therapy, but maybe I'm also seeking some advice, people with similar problems, or maybe just a sign of attention, understanding, and empathy.  
  
Thank you to everyone who has read this.  
  
Bye.",Stressed

227,"Crippling anxiety  I (21F) have had anxiety for as long as I can remember. I‚Äôve been in therapy since I was about 6. I had awful anxiety in middle school, it got better throughout high school and in the past year has become completely unbearable. 

About a year ago, I started having terrible anxiety again, and not just panic attacks. I began not sleeping until 4am, not going out with friends, skipping class and calling out of work. I wish I knew what my specific triggers were but I honestly have no clue. I‚Äôve tried Lexapro, which didn‚Äôt do much for me. And I‚Äôm currently on Buspar. It was working really well in the first couple of months but now it‚Äôs like my anxiety has almost mutated around it. It‚Äôs hard to eat, sleep, keep a conversation, or have motivation for absolutely anything. I can‚Äôt afford therapy any longer and I honestly don‚Äôt know how much help it was. I‚Äôve tried exercise, diet modifications, sleep remedies, self help books, yoga and meditation. It honestly seems like nothing is working. I keep obsessing over the ‚Äúwhat-ifs‚Äù and damn near losing my mind in the process. I can never seem to shut my brain off and I feel so absolutely helpless. Everyday I wake up, telling myself it‚Äôs going to be okay, I forced myself to eat breakfast and take my meds and go to work or school. But I keep feeling the urge to regress further.

Severe nausea that can make me throw up. Dizziness and fatigue. And as i‚Äôve come very aware to, no mental symptoms. 

Every therapist i‚Äôve ever been to has insisted that i have to have like thoughts of impending doom, circling ideas of something that will happen to me or others. Yk a fear. When i‚Äôve told them i don‚Äôt have that, they insist i have to, so i just end up making something up. Even though i know what is triggering my anxiety most of the time, it‚Äôs not something i‚Äôm scared of. It‚Äôs something i want to do and i can barely think of anything that could go wrong. It‚Äôs usually when im going out for dinner, going to a movie, going out with friends. Or anything along those lines. Sometimes even school, my dance classes or soccer practice or games.

232,"Social anxiety ig  I'm 20F and this is something that has gotten significantly worse this year tbh. I used to be super outgoing, I talked to many people, even strangers, without feeling awkward, I would even overshare information to everybody. Just stuff like having sweat stains or whatever.

I live with my bf of 4 years and we tend to visit his family a lot. His family is completely different from mine. There's a lot of interrupting and talking over one another. I don't relate to a lot of things they bring up in conversations either. I've never grown up on a farm nor have I ever done any farm work. But it just kind of taught me just to listen to them and keep my mouth shut unless the ask me, specifically, a question. My bf said that they've always been this way and that I can just talk whenever anyway, there will always be at least one person listening to what I have to say. I tried this once by just bringing up a short and vague detail to let them know I have something I wanna talk about after they had finished and then I got shushed for interrupting. I wanted to cry and now I've been keeping my mouth shut ever since.

It has somehow managed to make its way over into my everyday life. I dread phone calls, I get so nervous on any with someone I'm not particularly close with. Having to talk to a stranger or a hiring manager are the worst of the calls. I get that talking to somebody that has a say in if you have a job or not can be something that makes everybody nervous, but my mouth and throat will get so dry that I literally CAN'T speak anymore. I need to be 100% sure that I have a drink next to me now. I hate lots of public interaction, I feel so beyond awkward. Like when I'm grocery shopping and I'm looking at the same area on a shelf as someone else, I stand there and can't even focus on what I'm trying to look for, I end up blurting out something stupid to break the feeling and then it makes it even worse. I end up thinking so many interactions over and over again with all of the other possible ways it could've gone so much better.

Normally I'm okay with going out and grocery shopping, I'm someone that likes shopping in general, even if I don't buy anything. Today was a different story though. I already didn't feel like going out because we were having a lazy day but I had to so I could get things to make dinner with at home tomorrow. My bf also asked if I could pick up some Taco Bell too before I left the house. On my way to the store, I got such a deep rush of anxiety and I wanted to curl up, turn around, and head back home. Out of all days, the self checkout had bugged, the vegetables I had wouldn't show up, and I absolutely needed to ask for help for all of it. Not only that but it took so much more time for the food to get done at Taco Bell. Long enough for the worker to open the window back up to apologize a second time and  ask me how my day had been. This anxiety STILL hadn't left my body though. I was internally freaking out, trying to not make myself look like some kind of negative idiot. (I don't have anything against them taking that much time btw and the girl at the window was really nice. I'm not one to ever be rude no matter the circumstance)

235,"Overthinking/Anxiety  I‚Äôve never struggled with any sort of mental health problem until I started playing video games. It started out as a hobby, restricted by my parents when young. As I began to live my teen years, my self-worth and identify went into competitive gaming. I put away friendships, sports (d1 in soccer and track), my mental and physical health‚Ä¶etc into prioritizing something so meaningful in my head, yet so self depleting and soul-sucking. Yes I may have made good money doing it for a short duration‚Ä¶ this was my childhood though, 15k+ hours were put into my craft, and during the process I developed social anxiety, then signs of 5 different mental health underlying conditions. 

I‚Äôve been abased and abound, been at the top of the leaderboards in real life and in video games, and also not even able to function in my real life multiple times due to panic attacks, insomnia, and more. Yet I did not take the hint there is much more to life than these temporary trials and suffering I do not listen too. Many times there has been people and mentors that tell me I was going down the wrong path, yet I did not listen and persisted in my own willpower and demeanor. Not a sign of remorse now, just lost and have no direction or purpose. Used to get up early in the morning for tournaments and events, now I‚Äôm staying up till now overthinking, doing meaningless things, and seeking temporary contemporary activities. 

At a halt, I‚Äôm an adult in the teen years still, and it‚Äôs as if I have lost the sense of meaning or purpose of anything at the moment. Been on and off medicine throughout highschool, none of it stabilized my mental state more than being off medicine and living life in the real world, doing real things. I‚Äôm capable of creating my own destiny, what‚Äôs holding me back is applying what I‚Äôve written down and learned, as I‚Äôm a prophet for myself. Too lazy to go back to school and chase a meaningless degree, yet I can‚Äôt even operate by myself to hustle and create my own skillsets because of my mental state. Genuinely can‚Äôt even operate while pursuing these side hustles, lack of community and connection depleted my conscience completely. Angry at myself for where I‚Äôm at, as if I haven‚Äôt been in the same spot as I am now 5 times before. Hurt more peers, myself, and relationships because of my own ambitions, pride, and fear to walk into new adventures in life. 

Overthink daily care things to social situations to business meetings. I can go on, just never had to deal with any of this when I was balanced and healthy when I was younger before my teen years. I could have been helping others navigate through anxiety, yet I still struggle with it daily. I have so much unwavering potential in life, just at a plateau 12 feet into the abyss wandering around falling into calamity over and over again.

251,"Crippling Anxiety and Paranoia  I'm not looking for a diagnosis, but I could use some guidance or maybe just the knowledge that someone else has felt like I do. I experience really intense anxiety when other people around. If it's just a few I can handle it fine but as that number goes up, my anxiety goes through the roof. That's kind of always been the case in my life, but it got¬†*so*¬†much worse during COVID. I leaned a little too hard into the social distancing/isolation during the worst of the pandemic. I only rarely left my apartment to go on walks or errands. The small social support network I had kind of fell apart during the pandemic, too. I've thankfully still got a few very good friendships but we don't see each other as often as I'd like.

Since COVID, I've started to experience intense paranoia in situations that make me anxious. I feel like the people around me are constantly talking about me and how much they hate me. The fear of this causes me to really shut down and not engage with the those around me, which I then sense that they notice, and feel that they resent me even more for it. It kind of spirals in my head from there.

I just don't know how I got here or what's wrong with me, but it's affecting my ability to make and maintain relationships. I feel so alone. No one seems to experience the stress that I do, and it's so isolating. I feel like I tell my therapist what I'm experiencing and am treated like I have slightly elevated social anxiety.

256,"Crippling social anxiety  Hey guys, I'm not sure what else to do right now, so I guess I'm writing this to see if anyone has any ideas. 

I've always had social anxiety, but there has been times in my life where it was essentially non-existent. This is the worst it has ever been in my life and I'm not sure what to do to get out of it. It's caused my suicidal thoughts (which I haven't experienced prior in years) to come back as well, which also brings feelings of guilt because I've gone back downhill. 

I moved to another country in 2020 and have since gotten married and had another child. Prior to moving, my social anxiety was gone, and I had no issues making friends. It made me feel as though, even if it's difficult, I'd find some friends here as well. Obviously, I have not. My in-laws originally seemed to like me, but for some reason there was a shift after I had gotten pregnant, and now they don't want anything to do with me. I've tried to communicate and find out what I did wrong, but there's no use. This situation has caused me to feel as though maybe they always disliked me and I was fooled into thinking otherwise in the beginning. I'm made to feel as though I'm imagining it all, despite my husband seeing it as well. I've wrote it off as a loss and I'm trying to move on from it, as I've wasted too much time and energy on something they don't want to repair (or build?). This situation, however, has caused my social anxiety to worsen into thinking no one actually likes me and something is wrong with me. My husband assures me that's not the case and I need to just get out there, but it's gotten to a point where I don't think I even can anymore. 

I don't leave the house unless my husband is with me. I order everything online and even have Amazon arrange returns to be picked up from our house. If it can be avoided, even at a cost, I will avoid going out in public. 

I'm actually kind of content with staying inside and being alone. My issue is that it's causing suicidal thoughts again and I feel like I can't even go outside to get a loaf of bread. I also have no motivation to do anything I once enjoyed. I don't sing anymore, I don't embroider, I don't play video games, I just get what needs to be done day in and day out. When I have free time, I really don't do anything. Just kind of stuck with my thoughts staring at a wall, because I have no energy to do anything else. 

I know I need to just face my fears and get out there. But as I said previously, the in-law situation has caused a lot of damage. I feel as though, even if I find some friends, they'll be pretending to like me or I'll think they like me, and I'll just get hurt all over again. I'm scared and, frankly, tired of it. I don't feel as if it's worth it. I also feel as though maybe there's something wrong with me, some sort of cultural faux pas I always do that I'm not aware of, or maybe I'm just generally unlikable in this country. I had no problems making friends back home, but maybe the cultural differences are too much for them here. I don't know, because no one has told me what I did wrong or anything. ",Stressed
257,"childhood shows causing anxiety?  hi all! this post is kinda jumbled but i was just looking for some advice here as it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been leaving me quite uncomfortable. 

so for starters i am 18f and have been diagnosed with anxiety since i was about 10 years old. from there i was in therapy, very very low dose meds, and though my anxiety has lessened, i have felt a constant sense of danger and discomfort/uncleanness (if that even makes sense, like a feeling i want to crawl out of my skin lol) 

anyway, when i recall most of my childhood, from ages 8-13ish i remember absolutely nothing. like slight memories of random things here and there but for the most part it is a complete blank time in my memory. from what i understand and have gathered everything in my life was completely normal, great parents, stability, no known trauma, etc. still i have some like ‚Äúicky‚Äù feelings about my childhood if that makes sense. 

well recently, i was watching a familiar cartoon with my friends from our childhood as kinda like a nostalgic joke but for some reason it put me in a state of absolute panic. like i was in danger and everything almost froze. i thought it was just something weird and shrugged it off but curiosity got the best of me and i was confused as to why it happened. when i went home and the past week i have watched some shows from childhood here and there, specifically cartoons that i recall watching and they all give me a sort of immediate panic that i am in danger and unsafe.

my question is has this happened to anyone else? it‚Äôs not a prominent issue but it kinda concerned me and made me feel so vulnerable over something so small. is there a possible reason for this? is this just a common anxiety response?

sorry for the long post! thanks again for your help :)",Stressed

259,"Career anxiety?  Big vent, any thoughts welcome, just needed a space to air out my thoughts where I might get some feedback too. TL;DR at the end of the post.

My partner has just started a new job and is currently away on a training course.

I feel really guilty and anxious and pent up, not because he's away (I can cope with this better now because his last job required him to do sleep in shifts), but because I'm jealous? 

I'm not resentful of him or anything, but I am jealous because this is the second job he's landed with a decent salary, and I feel so, so stuck in my own job.

He's amazing, he does so well and researches so heavily for jobs. If he wants something, he'll go for it. I'm jealous of this attribute, I wish I had the get up and go he has. Both jobs he's had recently he's landed with no prior experience,  even above candidates with relevant experience/qualifications. They're also not jobs he's particularly passionate about, but he'll put in the graft because he's just that person. The salary obviously goes a long way as a motivator, but by not passionate I just mean they're jobs he's landed on without specifically searching for each of the roles.

He's done so well for himself and I'm so unbelievably proud, I know he does it for us and our life, which is why I feel so guilty for feeling jealous.

I talk to him about everything, but right now while he's away I don't want to go to him upset - he's too far away and it would make us both miserable, so I'm holding out until he gets home. I also feel some kind of way that makes me not want to say anything and make this big success of his about me when this is literally HIS moment.

I currently work in retail, as I mostly have done since my first job 8 years ago. I know I haven't been in the job pool long at all really, and some people's careers take different amounts of time.

I'm just struggling with my own motivation and happiness at my job. I'm looking around, but I'm not outgoing like he is. I find myself comparing us a lot in terms of job searches, etc. He's happy to help me look for a job, but how can I ask him to help when I don't even 100% know what I want to do and where I'd be comfortable going next?

It's quite a personal journey and he is very supportive but I just feel so stuck. I hate retail intensely, my job in recent weeks has taken somewhat of a toxic turn which is starting to spoil even the good moments. I also have a degree I'm not sure I'll ever end up using, which sucks even more.

I just feel stuck and a little hopeless, and guilty that I feel so jealous of his successes. It's overwhelming, I don't know where to start bar seeking out a careers advisor. I want to be in a new job that I LIKE before the end of the year, but I feel like all I end up doing is coasting because I'm so picky. I want my next job to be somewhere I really enjoy, ideally somewhere I'd want to stay but mostly just somewhere I can progress and learn so even if I move again I can do so having gained skills and such. I feel my current role has stagnated and there's nothing more I want from it, much less anything more I can actually GET.

TL;DR: I want a new job, my current position makes me endlessly miserable, but I'm stuck and also feel guilty about being jealous of my partner's success.",Stressed

Meaningless stuff like someone saying something mean on a video game chat, or things that have already passed, are now causing my stomach to be in a vice and my brain just shuts down.

My marriage is probably the area I wish I could improve the most, but it's not like we fight or argue at all.

The triggers are fairly innocuous and don't have a strong consistent thread. I'm beginning to think its some sort of hormone imbalance or something, but I haven't changed anything significant in the past few weeks.

286,"Panic Attacks? Anxiety Attacks?  So I (15f) have been having sudden panic attack like symptoms during certain class periods. It is worth mentioning that I have been diagnosed with both autism and anxiety, and that I have an extreme phobia of vomit. The symptoms I feel are as follows:
Nausea
Dizzyness/light-headedness
Inability to pay attention 
Increased heart rate
Shaking
Sweating
Difficulty breathing.
This only happens in certain classes, and in each of these classes I am somewhat sandwiched in the middle of the class (people do tend to stress me out). Moving seats isn't an option, so any advice?
Also, I don't even know if these are panic attacks or anxiety attacks. I looked it up, but the definitions were not helpful. Please let me know if you can.",Stressed
287,"Coping with Severe Flight Anxiety  Hi everyone,

  
I'm hoping to find some guidance and support as I deal with intense flight anxiety. The entire process, from buying a ticket to landing, feels almost inhumane to me. For about two weeks before a flight, I struggle with sleep and am plagued by bizarre dreams. On the day of the flight, I'm overwhelmed by sadness and feel inconsolable, resembling a frightened child during the flight itself.

  
After discussing this with my doctor, I've been prescribed 0.25 mg of Alprazolam (Xanax) to take on the morning of the flight, and 15 mg of Midazolam for when I board the plane. The flight duration is about 10 hours.

  
I have some questions and would greatly appreciate your insights:

  
1. Has anyone here taken these medications before? What should I expect from them?  
2. In the past, I've only used 2 mg of Ethyl loflazepate (Victan) for a short flight, which helped me relax a bit but wasn't enough for me to feel comfortable. How do the dosages I mentioned compare?  
3. Ideally, I‚Äôd like to sleep through the entire 10-hour flight, but if that‚Äôs not possible, I‚Äôd like to sleep as much as I can. Any tips or personal experiences would be really helpful.  


Thank you all for your support and advice in advance!",Stressed

I was and still am too anxious to do task, speak, go up to people etc, always quiet. I also had bad depression (not as bad now but still there) and would never speak out until i had to. He would let me smoke weed but the help was only temporary, it never really worked. My dad also wouldn‚Äôt let me do anything but sit inside the house for days on end without letting me go outside.

291,"Change and anxiety   Hi, I'm an 18 year old trans kid and I need help dealing with whatever going on in my head. I'll preface this by saying I have had severe anxiety (Specifically separation anxiety form my mym thats gotten better now but i still have generalised anxiety disorder) and PTSD from having norovirus (a common winter bug where you have flu like symptoms but the main ones being diarrhoea and vomiting) when I was 3 that left me hospitalised because I wouldn't wat or drink anything our of fear of being sick. Since then, I've struggled with food. I have become incredibly picky, I've grown to slowly try and get myself to eat new things but I stick with what I'm comfortable with. And I have a massive fear of throwing up. Specifically, having norovirus. Obviously, I've had it a few more times since I was three, but last January, I got sick with it (luckily I know why - something I'll get inot in a minute) and I was fine mentally afterwards. The fear was still there as always, but then in April I randomly began having panic attacks one day, in spikes like they'd rise and I'd have to leave the room and try figure out hoe to calm down, thinking it was over but it wasn't. And since then, the fear of throwing up is constantly in my mind and I can't control it. It got so bad I was out on anxiety meds, which was then tripled in dosage a month later because I was getting worse and it sort of helps. I began talking therapy, and in the room I'm fine but outside of it I completely breakdown on the inside. I don't know how to cope. I've been on the ADHD and Autism waiting list for months now, and something I noticed that got me to ask about being potentially autistic was how I reacted to sudden change. If its not planned, I freak out. This happened today. This morning I had to be at college for 9am for a 2 and a half hour exam for maths resits. I hate maths. And this morning, my bus was late, and it took over an hour to get to college due to the bus being full. I'd also like to take a moment to point out that I have IBS, and it comes and goes. I just came off my period today (I think) and this morning whilst waiting for the bus, my stomach was hurting and I knew I needed the bathroom. I'm familiar with having these kinds of cramps, but since my fear of noro has gotten worse, I immediately linked the cramps to me being ill, and I had the longest silent panic attack ever. For an hour waiting for the bus, another hour and a half on the bus, and then in a bathroom stall. I went to the bathroom, I wasn't sick like I KNEW I wasn't going to be but the fear was still so high. I was messaging my mum fanatically about being scared of being ill and what was I going to do because I was now 40 minutes late to my exam. I messaged my tutor asking if I could be put in a quiet room because the thought of being in the big room with everyone was making the panic attack so much worse, and she didn't reply. Luckily, my friend I'll name Red was late too, and told me to wait for her so we could walk together. I eventually left the bathroom (I went to the local shop on the way to college because it was closer) and stood outside waiting. Two other friends came out, immediately noticing I was crying and comforted me. Once I was with my friends, I calmed down so much. Eventually we figured out we could just walk into the exam room and jus have extra time if needed, and that was fine. But the anxiety was still there about me being ill. 
I know this is so sporadic, but i have to write this in order of events or I'll lose track, so I apologise in advance.
After the exam, we had teaching rehearsals (I'm in performing arts and we have a show next week) so my friend and I got changed into our costumes and did rehearsal. A lot of it was standing, sometimes going over choreography, until the lighting cues were finished and we did a full out rehearsal with the lights. We didn't warm up or cool down, so our bodies were just thrown into it - this will be useful later. We had lunch, I was starving so I ate a wrap and I knew I could eat more and chose not to (something I've learnt to do is to eat but never feel full. Recently I've had a few times where I've felt full and it's been nervewracking). We then just waited around as it was parents evening.
Here where the second change came in.
I showed my parents where to go, did parents evening and we left and went to the shop before getting a taxi home. Usually, I get the bus and walk back from the station so I can listen to music. This didn't happen, and I think it's thrown me in a loop. I ate a salad when I got back, I also took meds for my head because I had a headache and I didn't want it to progress into a migraine. I broke down about how I'm feeling. My body is aching (realistically because we didn't warm up or cool down and I wear short jean shorts for our dance and today was the first day I wore them for a rehearsal, and my thighs now hurt because of it) but in my head it's because I'm ill. I feel something in my throat and I think it's because I'm ill. My neck hurts and I think it's because I'm ill. I'm not going to eat anything else tonight because what if I'm sick? I'm so terrified I'm going to throw up and I'm so terrified that changes were made to my schedule that I don't like (that being mocks for maths, something I've really grown to hate and give up on which is making me more anxious). I don't know how to cope. I've been crying for an hour, finishing this now is making me cry. I don't know how to react to the changes that have already happened and I'm at home now I can't exactly reverse time and get the bus home instead. I can't take my usual route back that calms me. I can't have my mind without having the fear of having norovirus being there. What do I do? Therapy isn't helping, I hate going and I'm so glad it'll be finishing in a few weeks. Because I don't have my official diagnosis ( I have been told I have ADHD but they still haven't given the confirmation, and the autism waiting list is long) I can't get help in college or medically until I have them. 
I apologise this is like a story and a half.
But I really don't know how to cope. 
When I'm ill, I can't enjoy anything I usually love doing. I can't even try and relax, I just lay in fear. Videos I love start to increase my anxiety and I can't watch them, I spend hours trying to find something to listen to without feeling panic in my chest. And I feel like that now. And it's making me panic. How do I cope with change? And how do I control my anxoety towards being ill? Any advice is appreciated, and thank you to anyone who stuck around<3",Stressed

307,"Adult ADHD and Dental Anxiety   Adult ADHD and Dental Anxiety 


About 7 years ago my original dentist retired and I was disappointed because I trusted her fully. She also very caring and understanding because I have ADHD, depression, and anxiety.

Back in 2019, I had a bad experience with a root canal that left me traumatized and highly afraid of dentist. Plus one of the dentist there told me that I need to have all this work down, stating that I need multiple filling and crowns. I pretty much have a fill on sensory overload and had a anxiety attack.

So I left that practice and found a new dentist that understood that I had special mental health needs and I told them I had very bad dental anxiety. He was a very nice dentist.

But unfortunately his practice stopped takibg my insurance and my root canal filling pretty much fell out last December and had to go to a new dentist to have it looked at. It ended up being too damaged to saved and had to be surgical removal.

That appointment was not very comfortable to say at least, even with 6+ shot of numbing, I still felt a good amount of pain. But just about 2 weeks ago I broke a side of one of my opponent side molar and was told that I need to have a full examination.

The problem I have is with me having ADHD since I was young, I can get over stimulated very easily and become overwhelmed with too much information  being said at one given time. So I'm afraid of having the dentist telling me that I need all this work that should be done. 

I am terrified of going.

What can say to the dentist? So that they don't share too much information and that I just want to focus on the problem tooth.

Can the dentist office just put everything in a letter format and I can look at it at home?

The other problem is my dental insurance only covers about $1000 and financial isn't a option right now. 

Any advice would be appreciated because I don't want to continue feeling paranoid about my upcoming appointment.

I can't focus on anything, nor the anxiety itself to make it stop. It also makes me want to cry and I scratch my hands hard enough to make them bleed, and I get so irritated it's hard not to accidentally be rude to anyone who talks to me on that moment.

However, since I started 11th grade it has gotten much much worse, specially these last months.

When I get anxiety as soon as I wake up, I can't go to school since it makes me incredibly nauseous. It happens in class to. On my way to school. On my way home. When i'm resting. When i'm doing literally anything. I don't know why, I don't know the cause of it.

My therapist told me it's my worries taking over my head, and that I should try to ignore the feeling so my mind understands. I try that but it's not working. I tried everything. Never works. I even tried taking half a melatonin pill, but won't work either. 

Plus I have a really bad addiction to selfharm. When I get the urges of doing it, I get anxiety again and it doesn't go away until I selfharm.

I tried to listen to the new Taylor Swift album on XM but had to switch over to the 2000s channel to listen to better-known stuff now and then.

I slowly learned what anxiety was and the symptoms but it's hard to tell. I've always been told it's bad, it holds me back from life experiences, it doesn't let me enjoy things fully, etc. 

He said everyone has anxiety just those who struggle with it have the opposite minds as those who jump into things. When cavemen stumbled upon a moving bush some would just keep going along or maybe even explore it. But if it was moving from a predator or snake they'd be killed. If they had anxiety it would make them be cautious, think if it's safe or to avoid it. Anxiety let's us be extra aware of situations that could be dangerous. Yeah it can go overboard but anxiety itself isn't a bad thing. Anxiety is our brains way to keep us safe and aware.

326,"The Anxiety of Post Hacktivism  

The truth about hacktivism.

I have been sitting on this for too long, and I have to voice it. My mental health depends on it I think. I was an avid activist about 15 years ago and for a good solid 5 years I lived in the shadows in the realm of computer security. My day job is/was as a web engineer. (I will explain 'was') I certainly thought I was doing a public service and helping push transparency in our government. I had a romanticized view of it, and was very much unaware of the consequences. I also, at the time, was prescribed Adderall. I was prescribed by my GP.

Eventually, the anxiety of what it entailed as a hacktivist on top of the anxiety come down that comes with Aderall, led me to drinking, and drinking, and more drinking. I became homeless in 2017 after constantly failing at my real job. I felt so alone, so embarrassed. I still do feel both these things. I have not been able to hold a job for a good 8 years and I am still in the progress of saving my career.

The problem with being prescribed Aderall by a GP, is that I did not know about the anxiety come down. And I did not know to go speak to a psychiatrist about it. Hence the constant self medication. While homeless, I started pulling myself up. I found all of the public health programs, and got to see a psychiatrist for the first time. I am no longer homeless, but still hanging by a thread. I am currently interviewing, and I might have to move into a relatives shed if I do not get a job soon.

After 15 years, I am just now starting to heal. I stopped drinking. I study what helps me further my career. And I am starting to allow myself to share. I have very few friends, but the ones I do have are great.

My family only saw me as an alcoholic, and tried to force me into a rehab in the past. I knew alcohol was not the main problem, but a very serious symptom of the problem. I never told them about my past and they would never understand. It is harsh when your family has such a negative and harsh view of you. I can not say I blame them. I don't know. I just want the shame and pain to go away.

I am just so sad about it. So upset. I feel like an idiot. I feel like an impostor. I feel alone. With all of that said, I am moving forward.

337,"THINGS THAT MADE MY ANXIETY GONE, WHAT HAVE I CHANGED AND I FEEL HAPPIER THAN THE PERIOD BEFORE I HAD ANXIETY  Hello friends, as you can see from the title, I will explain how I got better during this whole process and how I realized and understood what I did wrong and WHY it was wrong, in a way that will explain it well and not be too boring.

DISCLAIMER: I can't tell you what to do, maybe you are already doing these things, or maybe there is another problem, I don't know, but maybe you can try these things, they worked for me;

1. Giving up sexual immorality and fixing the issues of relationship and love in my mind: I commited myself to the woman that I was in a situationship with,because I‚Äôve realized situationships and also things such as open relationship and playing hide and seek,hot-cold relationship are harmful and should be avoided. Any non-serious situationship and sexual immorality other than a named,commited,serious relationship is harmful. 

I learned the sexual function of the Oxytocin and Vasopressin hormones, so whether it is pornography, sexual fantasies that are over the top kinky and humiliating,probably even performed  to somehow ""mark"" the partner, whether it is cuckolding or trying to distant yourself with force because of fear of abandonment, whether it is talking to others while seeing someone,in short anything that can signal polygamy, cheating and cuckoldry into our subconscious,are pretty harmful.

Unless there is a committed relationship, there should be no half-assed person at all, and we should have as little history as possible sexually, stay away from himuliating and bad memory marking sexual fantasies, and have open communication about more innocence and love, and not create unnecessary pain and longing, 

I realized that such things are not jealousy or insecurity as todays post modern liberal media and feminism says,but a healthy relationship outlook.

2. Quit all kinds of drugs (yes,including weed), sugar, caffeine,nicotine and alcohol and stop seeing them as cool: Drinking these may not have caused any problems in the past, but after Covid and its vaccine, our body may have started to react more sharply to them due to some inflammation.

Just because those things didn‚Äôt affect me before,doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt be the cause,who knows maybe I got more conscious due to covid.Or like I said in the first place,they are just feeding the inflammation caused by the covid. I would say don't keep doing the bad things you used to do, who knows, maybe Covid or its vaccine didn't cause any problems, the thing that caused problems is that you gained awareness during the lockdown.

In any given scenario,these things aren‚Äôt good.

All these things are also constantly making you release dopamine which can inevitably end up in dopamine wornout.But don‚Äôt worry,neuroplasticity will replace those neurotransmitters with new ones.

PS: Cocoa has four times more caffeine then coffee beans,keep that in mind ;)

3. Socializing and having a job: I realized that socializing is not an addiction or needyness, on the contrary, it is something that should be in human nature. Likewise, having a job and earning money is not a bad thing,humanity always worked throughout his evolution,so helping with a load in a community sure helps.Just make sure the job youre doing is ethically sound and really needed for society,but even if you can‚Äôt find such job open,if you don‚Äôt need to work because you‚Äôre economically stable,then I say try to come up with something that can benefit humanity in most ethical and moral way.

But if you‚Äôre someone who needs to work or financially supported by a parent even though you‚Äôre finished college,go get a job and earn some money.Even if you reject the whole idea of work,there‚Äôll still be microphones and cameras needed to explain your propaganda,so not all works are bad,even if you‚Äôre an anarchist.

4. Stopping watching music and movies: Both in terms of the effects of these things on brain chemistry and the messages they signal to our subconscious and the mood swings they cause which is pretty unnatural to our evolution due to the fact that they‚Äôre pretty new,I was indulging in those things too much, like a drug in a way, and every drug creates anxiety.

I felt like if I didn't make music, I didn't deserve the woman I was in situationship at that time and it would be my fault if she left me; both because I was abandoned in the past and I myself did abandon someone,and unfortunately,when I connect the dots (which you should do top,just make sure you‚Äôre connecting the right dots) these events were seeded because of the simplification of relationships brought by this whole post-modern society.

But then I realized that if someone does not love me for what I am not by what I can offer,doesn‚Äôt matter whether it‚Äôs money or music,cars,houses or albums or movies, it is unnecessary to play stupid games and purposefully torture myself to starve myself of clarity in our relationship and communicate more daily instead of the once in a month we were doing because of I wasn‚Äôt a rockstar yet.(I know it sounds too cringe,but I‚Äôve gotta tell the truth) 

I realized these were childish things when compared to the possibility of real,unconditioned love.

6. I started to dream things that would actually help others: Rather than dreaming about personal pleasures,which I often did by playing an album and dreaming about how I,myself and I would be the niche-cult favorite-lore king cool.

It was all rooted down to my past abondance,then-current situationship where I was afraid to make a commitment and ask for commitment,my long before girlfriend and how we handled things in our intimateness and how degrading it was;and my way of coping with all of this big mesh by forcing myself to believe that open relationships,being careless,seeing love as neediness and lame,being alone as a virtue and anything else as compulsiveness was pretty against our human nature.

We shouldn‚Äôt hate human nature,everything is there because of a cause,we should understand it and execute properly.

Even anger has a place,if it wasn‚Äôt so then the evulition would diminish it.

We just have to handle them properly (Not in the sense of diminishing them or manipulating them,just be more conscious of them and use them to our fullest potential and avoid the harms that might occur if executed wrongly)

7. I have given up superstitions: And the belief that the universe's purpose is to teach me a bad lesson by beating me up with weird laws of attraction and the like.

But I‚Äôve gotta say,I understand that traditional wisdom was also real and they weren‚Äôt jusf pre science era dummies who just supposed things,they were the one‚Äôs who did their science by trial and error,and transferring their scientific results by telling tales and writing religious books.

So the thing that they refer to as spirit,might just be psychology.Different names,same thing.

8. I stopped keeping silent and not making criticism : I realized that we can be good by speaking out and discussing together, instead of keeping silent about people's situations and abandoning them,

I realized arguing is not a bad thing, on the contrary, it is better not to remain silent to preserve momentary peace over the real peace which is forever.

9. I understood the importance of sexual morality: And how men and women should behave and take responsibility regards to their chastity, 

And starting to act like a father/mother even if they were not going to have children. The reason for this is that it is in our nature to have children,and this might be the basis of what is called love and peace,this might be the reason of humanity‚Äôs longing for peaceful and organized environment,because of the well being of their offsprings.The whole notion of empathy might be flowering from there.

So a life that proposes a proper family structure might help,it did help in my situation.

And even if one hasn‚Äôt found the one,thinking about their partner in future and acting accordingly,which means not indulging in any sexual activity before settling down with someone,not being flirty with people all the time all around,and acting as if everyone will find his/her spouse one day so not making loose interactions with people around him/her.

Even if one wants to remain a celibate,not messing around and taking responsibility of sexual interactions by avoiding them.

10. I became vegan, I try to be compassionate against everything: I know this one might be impossible for you if you have serious health conditions,but all I can say is please try to minimize as much as you can in terms of your needs and wants.

And even if you must eat meat,please obtain it from a grass-fed grass-finished sources.

I'm careful not to crush ants even while walking.Compassion for others might give you the love you wanted,or even you can give that love to yourself.

I know the phrase ‚ÄúTo love others you must love yourself first‚Äù which is true,if you‚Äôre an humanity hating person it would be pretty hard to love anyone or anything,let alone yourself.

But sometimes,in order to love ourselves,we must love others first.Sometimes it‚Äôs the other way around.

11.Whenever something,some word,some thought triggered me,I asked myself these questions: What did I see when I had an attack as a result of a trigger? What could my subconscious be trying to tell me? What is it signaling? What kind of a moral rule might this represent,did I have violated that rule myself,now or in the past ? What is it that I see and why is it disturbing? And how can I make that thing disturbing? I realized that I needed to take a closer look and see what my subconscious was actually trying to tell me.

12. I did intermittent fasting : Still doing it pretty often,both to prevent overeating and causing a constant dopamine hit in my brain chemistry and to consume less juice in general.

13. I fasted and did one meal a day: So that if there was any anxiety-producing or anxiety-promoting bacteria in my body, it would go away.

14. I made my sleep regular, and I didn‚Äôt only in terms of getting enough sleep, but in natural hours,the natural cycle, that is, I prioritized sleeping 8 hours at the right interval rather than just sleeping 8 hours from 6 a.m to 2 p.m

15. I did dopamine detox: You can see what is explained in more detail on the internet. I did this to accelerate Neuroplasticity.

Basically in October 2023 my grandmother on my mother's side, of whom I was very fond, died of natural causes (cardiac arrest at the age of 84). Shortly after another event happened, which I prefer not to talk about, but from the moment these two events occurred, I began to suffer from severe separation anxiety towards my mother. I am very close to her, she is like my best friend, so every time she is away from home I always have a lot of anxiety and I often find myself checking her position.

348,"Feeling Numb after Anxiety Attack  My mental health history is ADD (there used to be a distinction between ADD and ADHD) diagnosis as a kid, but turns out it was ADHD and Autism. On top of that, Generalized Anxiety Disorder. A car crash in late December 2022 has caused quite a lot of Post Traumatic symptoms, which have only remotely calmed maybe 4 months ago.   
I am a nocturnal person. Daylight hours make me tired and exhausted all the time because of the constant noise of activity and the brightness of the sun, likely from the whole autism thing. Meanwhile, at the night, my mental activity is way more, and I am way more creative on top of it. It was one of the things that got raised suspicion in the first place.

Maybe all of that extraneous will give the intended context.  
Years ago, before the anxiety disorder diagnosis, I kept having anxiety attacks when I couldn't sleep before work at this hospital. It was a morning job, and as mentioned above, nocturnal person, so trying to sleep at all was hard. Then one day, I had one bad enough to last a few hours, and I called my job and quit. The boss asked if I was drunk, so I must have sounded off. I then slept for 23 hours and over a year later learned when I got the anxiety disorder diagnosis that attacks can be exhausting.  


This past Friday, I woke up after nearly 4 hours asleep before work at my current job, unable to get back to sleep. I called off, because it was effectively my Monday, and like hell I am starting 5 days in a row with 3 hours and 40 minutes of sleep, when the Saturday and Sundays that follow are somewhat early, and exhausting. I was able to get back asleep after about an hour and a half, altogether.  


And then it happened again on Saturday. Only this time, I debated calling for almost two hours while trying to sleep. This time, however, something snapped thinking about how I'm going to be unable to enjoy anything from how tired this is going to leave me, that something snapped. I got news of possible cancer in my mother's eye recently. Maybe that, maybe other things on top of it because a few days being ruined probably doesn't equal to the anxiety attack that very suddenly triggered here. I began hard sobbing - runny nose and all. This sobbing lasted about half an hour, and during which I called off again to which, having choked up a little on the phone I think they got it'd be best for me not to show up. The anxiety attack lasted close to two hours, during which I had several smaller periods of sobbing after the initial lot.   


I fell asleep for a nap finally around this point, and despite earlier, had a decent night. However, now comes the reason for this ridiculous trauma dump wall of text. I've been unable to really enjoy the things I like doing since the anxiety attack. That was three and a half days ago, at this point. Related to anything mentioned above, maybe as some kind of mental response? I read emotional numbness can be a response to an anxiety attack but I cannot imagine for 3+ days, so I am curious as to what might cause that.",Stressed

I lost a cousin very close to the family due to s\*\*\*\*\*; he j\*\*\*\*\*. Well, imagine waking up to that news. A few days after this traumatic event, I had a very strong anxiety attack (I didn't know it was panic then); I thought I would really go insane and wanted to go to a psychiatric hospital because of an internal debate, I couldn't sleep that night, thinking I would become schizophrenic. I was only able to sleep after listening to that meditation audio on Netflix, for which I am grateful. But then my thoughts became uncontrollable and fast, I discovered some channels on YouTube at that time, like Therapy with a Nutshell, which helped me a lot. After that, I experienced two panic attacks, which I now knew were panic because I had already discussed it with my psychologist. I had symptoms of derealization, felt so tense all the time, adrenaline so high that I was afraid to be alone and hear something, almost a fear of the boogeyman, I felt watched by myself, and the sensation of something behind me (which I knew wasn't there but due to OCD, which I later found out I had, the thought was obsessive). The worst part was that the symptoms and crises were very strong mentally, I thought I would lose control. Today, I am better, but I feel that I still don't feel ""normal"", I don't know if I will ever feel better, I continue to fear developing schizophrenia (hypochondria). Honestly, my thoughts when I am alone are not the best. I do therapy, take medication, keep my social life active, exercise, and meditate (which is great, but I don't do enough).

So I‚Äôll start by saying I (32F) have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I‚Äôve felt the depression side of things since my teenage years but it was never too bad and I didn‚Äôt speak to a mental health professional until my mid 20‚Äôs. The anxiety kicked in after a traumatic event in my early 20‚Äôs but that‚Äôs a whole other story. Since then, I have a constant cycle of thoughts about what could go wrong in any and all situations. This creeps into my personal life and relationships all too often and I feel like my worries and the burden of my needing reassurance is always too much for anyone I get involved with. Then when it doesn‚Äôt work out I don‚Äôt know if my worries were justified and I didn‚Äôt trust my gut thinking it was just anxiety or if I was just too much for someone else to deal with. 

Also to clarify, I‚Äôm not one of those people that wants someone‚Äôs location and passwords and all those things to keep tabs. My mind just goes into these scenarios and it takes me some time to talk myself out of it when my rational thinking kicks in.

I can pretty much only do small talk, but even then, all the thoughts just start overwhelming my brain. I constantly feel like people hate me, they only talk to me out of pity, that if I talk about myself at all then I'll be seen as self-absorbed, but if I never talk about myself then I'm not interesting. I feel like people are always looking at me, making fun of me behind my back.

And so I've stopped trying to form any connections. And it's severely impacting me. I'm constantly alone apart from the few friends I made in high school who I actually feel comfortable around, but we go to different colleges, so I don't even see them often. On campus, I have a few people I can talk to, but I'm constantly putting up a mask around them. They don't know really anything about me, because I've refused to divulge anything. I constantly feel like if I let people know anything about me it'll just cause them to abandon me.

Yet I constantly crave connections with people, so the fact I'm unable to form any is horrible for my depression. I'm seeing a therapist, but I can't even really explain my feelings well enough for her to understand.

I've had breakdowns over this multiple times in the past few months. Feeling like I'm useless, I'm a burden to others, I get in the way of their fun, they constantly have to pity me, and I know logically this isn't true, but my Gods does it feel like it is.

Every time I try to read something online, or get advice from people, they assume social anxiety is just being shy or introverted. And yea, I mean, I guess I'm pretty shy, but that stems from a constant stream of thoughts in my head telling me that everyone hates me and is actively avoiding having me involved in anything and the second I show up I ruin everyone's day, and when I'm running late for class they talk about how they hope I don't show up so class will be better. You can't fix that shit with some positive pintrest quotes and ""just getting out of your comfort zone"", you can't live, laugh, love your way out of constantly feeling like people only talk to you so they don't personally feel guilty if you decide to do something to yourself, even if you aren't actually wanting to.",Stressed

376,"Need advice for social anxiety  here's what happened: i am now consistently mentally stable at 25 for the first time since i was like 8 or something. however, since ive been in a hole my entire life, i never truly learned to socialize. i relied on the paranoia and coping mechanisms i had in order to reach out to people. so what used to drive my desire for socializing with friends is now gone.

getting better also means my newly diagnosed adhd isn't hidden by the tough guy facade i had while i was suffering. getting rid of my pain seems to have broken the mask. im not used to people seeing the real me and feel exposed. interacting with my friends (if i even get that far) feels harder now because of that. i run out of social battery so much faster than before. 

**tl;dr - my mental health is great now, my adhd has been unmasked, and now i dont know how to reach out to friends or feel comfortable doing so because my state of mind and view of the world is so different now after treatment.**

has anyone experienced something similar? what can i do?

377,"Anxiety or onset of schizophrenia?  Been going through hell the last few months. Started with an intense bout of health anxiety surrounding muscle twitches which developed during a particularly rough time in my grad school program. I was convinced I has MS or ALS.  
  
After fighting this for a few months I developed a bad case of insomnia where I wake up around 4 AM often with ruminating thoughts.  
  
After I got the all clear from a neurologist, my new fixation was that I started becoming hyperaware of my peripheral vision. This led to me constantly noticing things and looking that direction to confirm that I wasn't tripping. This still comes and goes. I haven't experienced any hallucinations, just hyper awareness.  
  
I also really struggle with falling asleep now because my thoughts become so jumbled and jump all over the place when I try to go to sleep that I become aware of them and it jars me awake.

Less than five days ago, I kinda anxiouss, I was about to embark to an old friend's wedding is CostaRica, it was an affair that...kinda scary addmmitedly, but yet a aprt of me desired to see how it would all pan out. Perhaps to the point I was lowkey excited about it...

Until the powers that be started the nuclear saberrattling again, assured the entire world they're not bluffing this time, and promised catasthrophic cosnequence sin return... Well, let's just say I had  to resort to swallow two whole pillows of clonazepam to go through the day in zombie mode. Because the alterative is to curl into a ball, in the darkness of my room and cry myself to a 2-hour sleep after which I will awaken in the grip of an existential dread so consuming that leads to furtehr crying and panic attacks. 

There, moments, such as right now, in which my mind has brief lapses of lucidity , bereft of dread and despair, hence why I'm writting this down: I've read that sharing these things and my feeling might help, along with all the other jazz regarding nuclear war anxiety: Focus on factual verified information *(Nuclear hasn't started, nobodody wishes to start a nuclear war, there tons of bright and capable people working around the clock (on both sides) to ensure it doesn't come to it, etc)* and it gives some brief moments of solace, but all that it takes is just some random person start rambling about ""Hey! We had a good everyone! Cya!"" or starts getting existentialist about how *""Our civilization has arrived to the great filter described by the Fermi Paradox""* 

You see, ts not that these stances are unreasonable, hell, it's not that my own fears are unreasonable, but the problem is that they are killing me. Slowly but surely. And I think I'm one big scare away of doing something stupid: Cutting my arms open or bashing my brains out, because I cannot stand it. I cannot stand the fear and uncertainty that all of this entails. Not because I want to die, but because my reactiont o the dread is getting ever more extreme: its like having a claw constantlky scratching your insides and the back of your skull, filling the holes with dread. 

And well...I know, no one can help. It's not something it0's in my power to solve. Medicine dulls things, makes them more bearable, but I'm no longer a functional human...and I'm supposed to attend my old friend's wedding five days from now xD.  So I guess this more for anyelse outhere that is feeling this way: Perhaps there is some wisdom in the old adage that says *""Ignorance is a bliss.""* because its better to live your days in happyness , ignoring the dangers of how bleak the world is, than linger as well informed husk.

I was wondering how should the session with psychologist look like?

I was diagnosed with disc herniation which slightly presses the spinal cord. Since I experience some symptoms in my pelvic floor, I always connect it with that herniation even if 4 PTs said that it is not typical for disc herniation especially at that level (thoracic spine th11/12).


Now it has been kind of up and down since some docs said it is not a disc herniation and some were trying to scare me with surgery (which itself is terribly scary for me but they also said rhat it will help only for some time and after 3 surgeries I will be left with ""agonal pain till the end of my life).

After 3 years, it became really difficult for me to function normally so I went to psychologist. I have had 3 pretty expensive meetings and all I was supposed to do was to talk what I feel and she did not say anything.

409,"Feeling Pressurized  Hey folks,  
  
I wanted to share my take on Islam, one that's rooted in personal understanding, critical thinking, and the quest for deeper insight. I believe that Islam encourages us to engage with our faith on a thoughtful and intellectual level, seeking knowledge and comprehending the rationale behind religious teachings.  
For me, it's not just about blindly following haram and halal guidelines, but about grasping the underlying wisdom that these practices hold. This approach allows me to make informed decisions that resonate with my personal growth, well-being, and spiritual journey.  
I'm keen to discuss: How do you all feel about exploring the reasons behind religious practices and using that knowledge to shape your own beliefs? How can we foster an environment of unity and open-mindedness within the Muslim community, while still embracing individual understanding  
I hope this accurately conveys your personal viewpoint on Islam. If you have any further modifications or additions you'd like to make, please let me know.  


**The Pressurization:**  
Last week, during a casual conversation with a group of fellow Muslims, our discussion turned to matters of faith and practice. As we exchanged viewpoints, I found myself expressing my belief in the importance of understanding the reasons behind religious teachings, rather than simply adhering to them without question.  
One of my friends, who follows a more traditional interpretation of Islam, shared their perspective on the significance of strict adherence to established practices as a means of preserving the authenticity of our faith. They expressed concern that too much questioning could potentially dilute the essence of our beliefs.

Few weeks ago he had other minor health issues which took me almost 3 weeks to convince him to go and see a doctor... eventually he agreed... at that day, before seeing a doctor, he had to go through some routine checks like blood pressue checkup... to the shock of the nurse he had his blood pressure 23_11, the nurse was sooo shocked and afraid, she asked him to go to emergency... but he refused... when i saw him he was soooo pissed off, he told me :"" you see, i shouldnt come here, i knew this was going to happen""... like wtf... your life is at risk and your acting like a child.... (plz dont get me wrong, i always speak with my brother with soo much respect, the way i speak to him or ask him to go see a doctor should not make him depressed)... eventually the doctor gave him a blood pressure medicine... its been a week now, and his blood pressure wont go down past 19 even though he is taking the medicine on daily basis...

Whenever i opens up the converstaion and ask him to see a doctor, he gets depressed... i will give you an example what happens, it is very similar when asking a person why dont you buy new clothes cz his clothes are torn apart, he would just look down to the floor and keep silent, as if he is asking for pity, while he have all means necessary to buy new clothes, the money are not a problem....

What pisses me off that he knew his blood pressure is getting over 20, and he used to refuse to take any medicine until now... he says he knows what he is doing, he knows what his problem is which is over weight...

I dont wanna loose my brother, we love each other very much, he is my best friend, his action clearly indicates a very deep psychological problem, which i understand him... but like wtf your life is in danger, your blood vessels could just explode due to high pressure and your not doing anything about it...

432,"Pressure to be better and reading books.  Hello everyone I will vent a little bit but I also hope you can find my post to be insightful. I‚Äôll just jump in. 

So earlier today I started reading a book about mental health (emotional first aid) which I recommend but I digress. In certain self improvement circles there‚Äôs an immense pressure to get better and to improve. This is something I have been a part of for some years and well it‚Äôs not exactly helpful, for me at least. There‚Äôs two sides to the coin, on one side sure a lot of dedicated work focused on making money, socialising or working out can have positive results. On the other side if you are struggling with mental health issues like I was/am the pressure and stress of seeing results was a net negative. These groups are often focused on money or making money.

In relation to making money I‚Äôve seen people say ‚Äútake 3 months and just read books on networking, investing and blah blah blah‚Äù and you will become super successful! When I was reading earlier that thought struck me, however to counter I thought man I don‚Äôt give a fuck about ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù or getting rich. I just want to feel a little better :), so I would rather read all the mental health books. The book I‚Äôm reading right now has been nice and helpful, tons of neuroscience on how reading is good and how it can improve mental health but I won‚Äôt get into it here.

The only good thing such groups teach is that it takes effort to achieve what you want. But going about it ‚Äúhustle‚Äù style is wrong.

To tie this all together I want to say that you definitely should read books on mental health but no pressure man, take your own pace and don‚Äôt force yourself into reading. Listen to some peaceful music, take it slow and be gentle. Hope you found some value reading this. With that being said if you do have any recommendations for well written books on the subject please share! Take care :)",Stressed
433,"Is intentionally putting pressure on your ears a mental health issue?  [I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub to ask this. I've tried googling it but couldn't find anything.]

Ever since childhood, I've been, for lack of a better word, ""pressurising"" my ears. Think ""doing the opposite of popping my ears to get rid of the pressure"" to get an idea. I do this frequently, pretty much whenever I notice that the pressure is gone. The reason I started doing it was that I realised having pressure on the ears dampens the volume of what you're hearing, and since I'm _very_ sensitive to noise, it's granted me some relief. I always knew it was odd behaviour, but tbh, I never really thought much of it (I've always been a weirdo, so I'm kinda used to myself doing weird things), but now I'm wondering if other people do it, too (maybe there's even a term for it? Like onychophagia for nailbiting, though I'm pretty sure it's way less common than that), so I could maybe get some tips on how to stop doing it, because I'm struggling with breaking the habit.

Other than that, there‚Äôs periods of just generally feeling in a low mood, which is the specific reason why I decided to make this post, because I wasn‚Äôt thinking of making one before but today, I got really upset.

I was excited because I was planning to do some writing, not actual stories but basically, a sort of database for a series I‚Äôve been planning (at least, one of them). I was watching videos about crafting stories from a really nice YouTuber and it just made me feel really hopeful, I guess. But then I started doing the actual writing, I was writing character descriptions and information like that and it just felt so hard all of a sudden, I really didn‚Äôt feel like what I was writing was good even it was just facts about my characters for reference and not something for publishing or anything. I just got really upset all of a sudden, starting to think about upsetting things from the past, fearing the future (the exact opposite of what I had been feeling mere hours before). It was just scary because I‚Äôd been looking forward to really getting back into writing but then I just felt... bad... Doubting myself, ‚Äúmaybe this is a sign I shouldn‚Äôt be writing‚Äù, even though it‚Äôs the one thing I feel I could be good at and make a career out of. I‚Äôve actually sort of felt this way before from thinking my writing was terrible but with how much of a rollercoaster these past few months have been, it just felt worse...

I just feel pressure all the time, everything feels really serious or something. I probably should have stopped writing for at least a few minutes if I wasn‚Äôt in the right mood but stopping something is hard, I guess because I can‚Äôt really think straight in the moment, even though getting myself to *start* doing something productive like that was hard too. I remember I was literally telling myself ‚ÄúOK, you‚Äôre sitting here at your desk with your laptop, you‚Äôve eaten, you‚Äôre calm‚Äù... but for some reason, I had to *force* myself to start.

I‚Äôm currently in a rental where the bathroom is shared with one other young woman, who is generally chill and kind. My landlord (who also lives in the house) observed that I spend around an hour in the bathroom (once he remembers longer) for my shower and getting ready process. He wants me to take approximately 15 minute showers and thinks it‚Äôs wrong of me to spend an hour in a bathroom that is shared. I told him it would be totally fine with me if my roommate did the same, and I offered to knock on her door or text her before I shower to make sure she doesn‚Äôt need it. He doesn‚Äôt want me to do that though. As far as I know she is fine and hasn‚Äôt been upset about anything. Not sure she would mention it if there was something wrong though. There‚Äôs so much more to it all, but suffice to say I‚Äôm not taking that long out of choice. I feel like I‚Äôm being watched/monitored, and I need to shower and get things done but this adds another layer to the stress and fatigue I was already dealing with. 

I deeply want privacy. I‚Äôm moving soon and have to clean and do laundry for my own private space before I go (which means I will need to shower and complicates the process a bit), and he mentioned that there were some other things I did that were an issue, but refused to tell me what. So now I‚Äôm like, what if I do something offensive but don‚Äôt know what it is? 

Prior to the conversation with him today I already felt stressed living here, but now it‚Äôs  a whole new level. He did not handle the conversation well. 

Help, you guys. I was already being strong through some big stressors and physically not doing great. I‚Äôm just not ok. I don‚Äôt have anyone to vent to or get feedback from and I feel alone and daunted.",Stressed
439,"Everything feels like pressure to me  Staring outside the window of my new half-finished appartment, where I moved into 2 weeks ago, closer to friends and reasonable city. I'm not sure what to feel anymore. Instrumental music made me cry today.

In short: 36M. Started developing my mental health after half a lifetime of bullying on the tender age of 28. But it's damn hard. Feel late at everything. Had 2 relationships, the most serious one I ended in june. Couldn't commit due to her health issues, and made a mistake during that relationship. The first relationship left the country for traveling, she's back now but that's not going anywhere. Other F participants are not there in my life, no matches, only some random people in Indonesia.

Fitness: slacked off massively since covid in august/september. I want to pick that up again. Dad warned me to not start doing this as well and fix the house first, but that's bullshit. I know this works better for me, go to different places and make an effort.

House: decided to put in the floor and wallpaper myself, with friends. Welp, that escalated terribly, was a bit ambitious lol for a first time. Should have taken 1 project at a time, in that sense my dad was right. But it means 40% of wallpaper needs to be finished, the floor 70%. I live inbetween. Older furniture, needs some additions.

Me: usually quite low confidence. Starting new projects, not finishing them. Struggled with perfection, and motivation because results are not visible quickly usually. Friends are on/off. I feel like I have to drag everything along with me (there are some friends who take more initiative, I'm happy about that). Had mental help (psychologist) for 3 years approx., with some gaps this year because I wanted to stand on my own feet, less talk, more action.

Money: I have no worries, leading a quite budget life. But to buy a house (where?), only a closet is possible in the near future. Employment is a disaster with no longterm prospects.

Jobs: on and off. Last couple of years I worked in covid department for 32h/week, now switching from journalism (failed) into more social work because I like that. Have to finish up budget counseling study somewhere in january, that was an opportunity I jumped at, but I don't feel too sure about finishing the exam in a proper way.

Family: 1 side non-existant. Barely attempts to connect with me. Not even during the summer where grandmom died. The other side: warmer, but mostly a very passive, frustrated and disabled, but very kind aunt, with a hardworking cousin I grew up with, but he mainly makes me feel like he knows everything and can help me with everything. That feels very skewed. But it's connected to my selfimage as well, partially.

Parents: nearly 70. Mom has ongoing (chronic) illness since the 80s, reclusive in home for 20 years now. Frail. Poor personal hygene. No hobbies. Some OCD symptoms? She is very inactive. Everything is about what happened (strong reaction to the word 'trauma', I know some things but definitely not all of it, was quite traumatic) but she doesn't talk to a doctor, and says barely anything about herself. She doesn't pick up on the idea that she is more than everything that ever happened to her.

Dad: worked his ass off all his life, freshly retired but depressed as hell after 2 narcistic daughters and ex wife, plus non-supportive family. PTSD diagnosed with some heavy shit. Intercommunication between them is a disaster at times, i have to fill in blanks between them. mom says he doesn't see the value of talking to a pro about it. Covid hit him hard in March '20, plus battle-scars from 50 years physical work. He stresses about everything and anything, bitter.

Him: talks about 'yeah those last few years'. 'We are taking care about X / Y insurance things / cleaning out for when we're gone'. This is reaaaaaally depressing. 2 weeks ago my father visited me suddenly, and told me he was thinking about voluntary admission. But he didn't feel it, was afraid it would be wasted effort without result. Our minds can come up with so many excuses.. So he needed some weeks.

Last week with christmas he cooked for the first time in 2.5 years, and nearly fainted from exhaustion. Slept for 4 hours. Then it was all fun and games when mom was awake too, but normal bedtime for me is 12:30am. It's not normal when your father wants to show you music videos from the past at 1:45am, while you are standing there almost falling asleep, and mom offering coffee. They went to bed around 5:30am.

Next day he was overworked and slept during the afternoon. Mom and I talked for 4 hours straight. Also about help. But she never goes, not if I say I'm on her side and listen, or offer to go with her. Then he came back into the room, and starts planning about shelves and everything here. This is not what I wanted, I got physically ill, just wanted to spend some quality christmas time together. He wants to help (sees me/my apartment as a project to keep himself occupied) too. But he took my rejection of that, when I eventually stood up for myself, reasonably, but he definitely wasn't happy (mom says to me alone he tries to help me, but he struggles). Then he decided to eat all the 'witlofschotel' and was violently ill on his bed the whole night, with mom very tired as well. I promised, as a peacemaker, to call him wednesday about it. I haven't. My back problems made my life worse, but it's an excuse. Fucking hate christmas like this.

They have barely any social network, and make each other stress out and not function well, including bowel movement problems and everything. They refuse any mental help after some bad experiences, dig for answers within themselves. Well, that's not going to help anyone now, is it? Nearly everything is disfunctional over there, and it has a massive toll on me because I don't know what to give without losing myself. And it's a bad example for me too. Nearly only problems when you go there. I usually feel disheartened to go there. Both parents have a good heart, but they behave like they are worn out (they have some solid reasons, but there can ALWAYS be a fresh start. But I feel there's no way back OR forward. Nothing's going to change.

I feel rejected because my friends have families/gfs and therefore occupations, but there are no invitations for me it seems. This made me feel seriously irritated, especially at my better friends. I feel overwhelmed because I feel I have to fix everything (job, house, spouses, my future family / dating) because it's all unstable as hell, and I feel undervalued, or I have too high expectations of everything. Made some spiced biscuit cake. I think I'm picking up the car for half an hour and go to my parents for a short bit, or put it on the doorstep. Haven't decided yet.

In my new house I want to invite people (loneliness is a thing, computer abuse a second), want to pick up a hobby like playing saxophone, starting a stream, bake at times, be fit and creative. That's present tense, but right now I feel like nearly nothing. Although this relieved me quite a lot, for now. Thank you for your patience. It's been a long write. Questions are welcome, I can imagine not everything would be crystal clear.

Edit: I wish you all a very good 2023, that you'll come farther than you are now. Be proud.

441,"I don‚Äôt know how to continue under this pressure  Tw/mention of self-harm

So I‚Äôm (M19) in my first year of uni rn and the year is almost done, but I‚Äôm not doing great. My grades have been sub-par, I‚Äôm not as social as I‚Äôd like to be, bad thoughts enter my mind.

I‚Äôve recently moved from my hometown to my uni-town for easier travel and however great it is to be on my own, I‚Äôve underestimated the effect it would have on me and my mind. I hoped the new environment would create a more disciplined, social and efficient me, but I‚Äôm still not at the point I want/need to be to carry on my daily life and stuff. I procrastinate everything, from revising for a test to simply cleaning my room a bit. 

I‚Äôve struggled in the past with certain bad thoughts, due to early traumatic events, but got help for it. However it has stayed creeping in my head, popping out at moments of great stress, like right now. This time it‚Äôs gone a but further tho, since I‚Äôve started some actual self-harm now. I hadn‚Äôt done it before, but now it was too tempting to release some pressure and feel something different than the pressure I‚Äôve been experiencing.

A usual way for me to resolve anything like this would‚Äôve been socialising, but that is hard atm due to retakes on exams, holidays and people being busy. Unfortunately I also don‚Äôt have many close friends, I‚Äôm lucky with quite a few fun and nice friends but not many I dare share anything more than my happy side with. 

I‚Äôm quite lost, but I‚Äôm trying my best to make anything from it, doing my best to pass my first year and continuing my studies.

443,"Struggle Between My Desire To Meet Someone Vs. Feeling Inauthentic, Due to Lack of Financial Pressure and Vocational Direction  I am 29M and I am single. I feel like everything that I do in my life has always been done with the intent of potentially meeting a girl. 

For more background information, I used to go to school but stopped going after a bad breakup as she was in the same program. 

During the relationship, I lost all drive to go back to school because I realized my desire to meet someone was the main driving factor in going to school, not the pursuit of a career. 

Further exacerbating my issue is that my parents never encouraged me to work outside of the family, mainly my father. I have done work for him, but since he has retired after a great deal of success, so have I. 

I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt get a job, pursue a career through school or volunteer because the desire to meet someone is a stronger driving factor than the non-existent financial pressure  is and the vocation of doing something is. 

This tug of war between my desire of meeting someone vs. my feelings of being inauthentic puts me in a precarious position as I don‚Äôt know where my future is headed or how will I meet someone. Additionally, once I meet them what will I do? I feel like at this point I could just stay at home until the day I die, which it‚Äôs really boring for me. I feel like I will never grow up. 

So far I have tried to get out of the house by going to the gym, doing all the families grocery shopping, going rock climbing, trying to join clubs, reading at cafe‚Äôs instead of at home, and even though I have met some people, I haven‚Äôt made any long lasting connections since at least 2021. 

It really bothers me because I am not lazy, and I am always busy, but I am always busy doing stuff for myself. These feelings have been catching up to me and I have been getting more sad lately because I feel like I am moving, but moving in one spot, doing the same thing every day. 

I feel like I am trapped by my own circumstances. I have not met anyone in my situation, and my friends and family call me a prince as a joke, but I have no one else to relate to. 

 I tried therapy for a few sessions and hated it, and definitely didn‚Äôt have enough to talk about during the sessions so it felt like a waste of time and money, so am searching on Reddit for support as a fresh alternative. 

TLDR: Post-breakup, grappling with the conflict between the strong desire to meet someone and feeling inauthentic in conventional pursuits. Previous therapy attempts proved unhelpful, now seeking a fresh perspective on Reddit for support.",Stressed

446,"Too much pressure on myself?  Hi,
I‚Äôm 15. Around the start of the year, I fell into the dark side of self improvement (getting hooked on the videos, pressuring myself, etc.) and I suppose from that I started to believe that my life was shit? Maybe not shit? But it could be better maybe? I can‚Äôt really put it into words.

Anyway, while I have adopted a few good habits/actions from the whole self improvement lobby thing like the gym (which I will discuss in a min) and the kind of consciousness and awareness about my mental health I have been distancing myself from the whole self improvement market. Market? Not sure.

However, I think I‚Äôve picked up some bad mindsets maybe from it. I find myself always setting goals, scrapping them and then setting goals again. Pretty much a viscous cycle. And I put so much pressure on my self when I have these goals that I end up in a kind of rut over them and feel really overwhelmed. I think maybe now I‚Äôm realising that I don‚Äôt need such big goals at my age but I still do think there is a place for the normal ones like do well in exams and build a good physique (that‚Äôs more of a hobby/past time thing) and keep healthy. One of them would probably be to have a good mental health as well.

But even after realising this I still can‚Äôt help but feel overwhelmed and I‚Äôm constantly stuck in a rut. I have no idea what to do. I‚Äôm conscious of wasting my teenage years worrying and stressing over things like this but I‚Äôm also aware of how I want to succeed and progress and improve myself step by step.

Sorry if this sounds really jumbled or whatever it‚Äôs basically just a dump of my mind I haven‚Äôt really structured this post.

447,"I stood up to people pressuring me, but need outside perspective; am I right about where I set my boundaries?  I was posting on Jodel and wrote about a rape I witnessed and reported. One reply said it was a good thing, but also suggested I see a psychiatrist. I am wary of people who say this, because I have been gaslit and pressured for years with that suggestion.

I asked the person what they meant and they said it would help with remission, which has a specific meaning and implication. When I asked them to clarify what they meant, their response told me everything I needed to know.

I responded by telling them I lost all trust in them, and explained it is because I have been through years of mental abuse by people gossiping about my mental health and gaslighting with that 'suggestion'. I expected that to be the end of it. But the discussion suddenly involved others, telling me I was over reacting, trying to correct my behavior.

I continued to stand up for myself, and kept to my points; it was crossing boundaries to suggest to someone they seek mental health help when they aren't a close relation. I did not use nasty language with anyone or say anything bad about people, yet people said I was being toxic towards the person I lost trust in.

The discussion pivoted towards a correction about how I should have said it in the first place. That I should have just declined their suggestions. But what I want is a clear communication; here is my boundary, and what they did wasn't okay.

A woman I was talking with in private saw the discussion and said I needed mental help or I would always be alone. I am realizing I am absolutely better off not knowing her now; she asked about my mental health in private, because I have this habit of talking at length and recent traumatic events leak into what I say. I get that concern, and because she has to consider others, I can accept her asking, and was upfront with her. But her last statements to me, saying I would be forever alone, I will pass on her.

451,"Healing Under Pressure  It was December 2011 and I was just about to start my shift at Claire's. I had just passed my supervisor training so I was pulled from store to store. This particular day I was managing a store in a large town in Hertfordshire. It was just like any other morning except it was the day after boxing day and I knew it was going to be crazy busy in store. I went in extra early to make sure the banking was complete and the tills were set up. 

I was expecting a young girl who was on holidays from uni to join me opening up but I hadn't met her before. While I finished setting up I heard the back doorbell ring, I thought it was either the girl I was working with or the stock delivery guy. We didn't have a spy hole in the back door so we had to act on our judgement. I opened the door and nobody was there, so I step back and proceed to close the door but out of nowhere 2 men dressed in dark clothing start forcing their way through the door. 1 of me, 2 of them. They push me to the shop floor but no one can see what's happening as the shutters are down. I can hear them trying to get into the tills...they ask me to open them and I told them there was no key for me to open to till. They look around the store but there's nothing of value for them to take, until I'm forced into the back office where I'm told to open the safe, again I told them there was no way of me opening it, I was then shouted at, open the safe or I will shoot you! What is a few thousand pounds over a life? 
I opened the safe and gave them what they wanted and they ran out of the back of the store.

Never in my life have I felt so vulnerable, I was in shock and my head was all over the place. I called the police and within a few minutes they were at the store armed. 

So many questions kept running through my head. Why this store? Did I do the right thing? Was it my fault? What will people think? 

After the robbery happened I received very little support from my employer. My handbag and purse sat in the cloakroom for over a week and nobody even reached out to bring it to me, guess what..I had to go back in the same store and get it myself. After a few days I was constantly asked by my manager when was I coming back to work. I was earning ¬£11k a year as a store supervisor for them to ask me when was I coming back to work...

The pressure of going back to work meant I did not heal. My body did not heal. I was anxious everyday, I had panic attacks and all I got in return was a transfer to a different store. Claire's is a huge company and the way they handled the situation was absolutely disgusting. I wasn't offered and help or additional support they just wanted me back in work as they were paying me to have time off.

Have I healed?...no. 13years later and I still struggle with stress and anxiety. Not only did I save the money in the tills that day but I also lost a part if me.

This story is apart of my healing process. No company should ever make you feel like your just a number in this kind of situation. Until this day I do not shop at Claire's, they didn't deserve me as an employee and they don't deserve me as a customer.",Stressed

My mental health was stable since last few months and it had come back due to the things which are completely out of my control. Being a grad student in one of the Tier One universities in the US, I know I am at least an above average student and will get most or all of my work done. I was infected with Covid(though I was fully vaccinated) in the beginning of this semester and the infection was towards the severe side. The infection stayed for 12 days but the side effects remained for the next 2 months. These side effects include body pains, exhaustion, shortness of breath and brain fogging. I know, this combination doesn‚Äôt go well with someone with mental health issues.

As I am a student with integrity, I have been updating my professors about my health and have already notified them that I might need help regarding academics. But with just one more month to catch up with 3 advanced courses, I really don‚Äôt think I can do it. I have talked about this with my academic advisor and they said they can‚Äôt do anything about it. This means that I can‚Äôt even withdraw from the courses, I am on track to fail them.

Apart from this my mother is very sick and things are getting very bad for her as well.

The mental pressure from these external factors are killing me from inside. I feel very suicidal not because I don‚Äôt want to live but because I don‚Äôt want to face the consequences which are not under my control. 

On the contrary, I wanna live. I wanna bring great changes in my life and hopefully in this wild yet beautiful world. But the position I am in right now will make sure that my life wouldn‚Äôt move forward. And I am done hoping for a better world for myself. Oh God, why do we have to face consequences for the choices that we did not make?

468,"I cant relax because of school pressure  Hi, I am not sure how reddit works and if I am posting this right, this also is just a throwaway account as I don't want to bother my friends and family or teachers with this, because they all think I'm fine and happy. But I  need advice how to deal with school stress. 

I am 15 years old and in my country the school system has, what you can call levels. I'm not necessarely smart, I just really live by the thought to work hard and try your hardest. For some reason when you do a higher level people expect so much more from you than they do from others. For example my brother did a level lower than me and when he got a 6 it was a miracle and worth celebrating. (Grades are 1-10, 10 being the best) However when I get a 6 for a subject I struggle with ,like math, I'd be happy and relieved. But my mom says she expected that I would only be satisfied with a higher grade. I don't really care for my grades as much, it's just that the feeling of people with authority (adults) being dissapointed in me makes me feel worthless. This isn't just with family, but also teachers. Like when I got a bad grade for a subject I normally got good grades for, my teacher expressed how dissapointed he was in me. But he only looked at one bad grade, not my other grades. My parents don't force me to study or get good grades. I'm just scared of being the dissapointment daughter. I want to get good grades so adults are proud of me, so they think I am not just some stupid kid.

When I look back at my school year, the only thing I can remeber is studying in my room for long boring hours untill it was late in the evening and I couldn't anymore. The only free time I had was about half an hour a day right before bed, in which I didn't have the energy to do any of my hobbies like drawing or baking, so I'd just end up scrolling through my phone. I haven't had any chance the whole year to do things I actually wanted to do and enjoy, so now it's my first day of the summer holidays but I just can't enjoy it and feel stuck. When I used to relax for a minute when I got home out of school, this massive pressure and guilt feeling formed in my head. Because I felt like I didn't have a right to relax as I still had homework and studying to do and It would only be gone after I thought I worked hard enough to earn my free time.¬† I just finished my testweek and I have no more work to do but that guilt feeling still exists in my brain. I don't feel relaxed enough because I am convinced it can't be over, I have made a lists of all the things I want to try and do in the holidays but I don't feel capable of doing anything because of the pressure. 

Besides this feeling I've also had trouble with sleeping since and during the testweek, I feel uneasy and just keep moving. Even though I go to bed exhausted. I've also missed my period for about three months, I suspect because of the stress. I've also become really fidgety since this year. It started with plucking my hair out, which caused it be very frizzy and uneven now. Luckily I don't do that so often anymore. Now I touch my face sometimes, mostly just scrathing my acne, which caused it become worse over the year. It helped that I started wearing more jewerly, so I can fidget with my ring or necklace instead of my hair or face. But under more extreme stress like tests the previous ones come back and I still do it now in the holidays.

474,"My therapist is pressuring me into having in-person sessions  I started seeing this therapist almost 3 years ago. I came to weekly sessions for around 4-6 sessions before switching to virtual/online sessions as this was when the pandemic started. Over this period, we switched to biweekly sessions.

About 1.5 years into that, he would ask if I could come in for in-person sessions again. At the time, I told him I'm not comfortable with that and would like to keep it virtual. He didn't push the issue further until around 6 months after that. Now, these conversations are becoming more frequent this year.

I've explained to him my reasons for wanting to keep things virtual:  Eliminates the risk of Covid, convenience (I only have to devote 1 hour instead of 2-2.5 hours of time), easier to fit into my work day, etc. I told him that I still go to the dentist, visit the doctor, do some grocery shopping, visit friends/family, etc. as those activities do not have alternative methods. For in-person therapy, the alternative is seeing him online/virtually. I will say I am more cautious than most when it comes to covid, but I'm also not avoiding major things in my life and being a shut-in.

Today, he kind of raised his voice at me and I could tell he was frustrated. No matter what I said, he kept going in this loop and I'd have to explain my reasons again. I asked if it was anything about money or perhaps maybe more insurance paperwork or something. He said it's not money-related or insurance-related at all. He then said he's an old-school face-to-face type of person and it's just better for him and that I'm the only one that still sees him virtually.

I reiterated that I'm just not comfortable and it's more convenient for me. Going forward, I feel like I would have this looming over my head and that we'd just have yet another conversation like this. I've already explained my reasons to him 3-4 times this year.

Another thing to note: He has already gotten sick with covid twice whereas I have not caught it once.

We get along great and have a pretty good relationship but we aren‚Äôt like best friends. We literally talk about the same things and then go about our ways. I can‚Äôt help but feel pressured to hangout tho. For context I love being at home. I love being at home with my partner but mostly like being alone too. My alone time is everything to me.

I would say every few weeks. Just a check in and maybe a plan to hang out. When we do hang out it‚Äôs great but I feel drained so then I go a few more weeks without speaking to him. I‚Äôve already told him that‚Äôs just how I am. He thinks we need to see each other every other week to hang. For me that‚Äôs just too much. I feel weird about needing so much time for myself but I do need it. Lately ( pass few months) I‚Äôve been feeling very pressured to go see my sibling/family.

476,"Advice/help - am I purposefully isolating? or is it social pressure/FOMO?  Hey everyone, I hope you're all doing well:))

I have a short question regarding self-isolation vs self-care (if that makes sense).

4 months ago, I decided to take the drastic step of going to the gym because I was so done with my self-esteem issues. I know I was doing my body a disservice and decided to do my best (I couldn't even do a single push-up). Because I prioritize uni and training, I have stopped going out completely (no heavy drinking, partying, etc.) and generally only meet with a couple of friends (3-4) to have a coffee/go out for dinner. I also stopped going on any social media at all (God that was a hard af step), because it really affected my mood and FOMO:(

These steps were super hard for me to do & I really had a lot of struggles and fallbacks but I managed to hold out until now.

I've noticed I am eating better, getting better sleep, am in no drama at all at uni, and getting all my work done. My anxiety regarding uni (passing exams, etc.) has really significantly decreased, and I'm really, really grateful for that. My gym training abilities also are going great, which I am super proud of (I finally can do pushups!:))

I am pretty young still, so a lot of people at uni started to look at me weirdly for not jumping at any opportunity to go out drinking like I used to. A lot of people who I have kinda 'cut out' are starting to approach me asking why I am not hanging out. Some (who I don't even know well), told me that I should stop 'self-isolating' and have 'more fun' and not be as stuck up...I was really shocked at this because I don't even know these people properly. 

That's why I decided to come on here and ask if my behaviour is self-destructing? Or am I doing ok? I really felt happy with the changes I've been doing, but since I've been getting this reaction from people I know and even strangers, maybe there's something to it.

Through out life I tried to stop thinking about very negative things and I was able to do this eventually (In a very unhealthy way), this led to pressure pains in my head when I try and stop thinking about things, but I've done it so much now that it is automatic. I hardly ever think about bad things now, but instead it's replaced with a very painful stress placed on my head, the only thing I can describe it as is a tension headache. The pain also happens when I am concerned that someone is thinking something bad about me, which I don't know if this is my brain trying to stop the bad/negative thought or what but it's becoming a big problem.

in the everyday uphill battle that is my job (on the front lines of customer service, it's hand-to-hand combat), my goal in the fight is just self-defense and to hold my own. i don't need to try saving everyone from their work because they're capable of defending themselves as well.  of course we still cover each other and help but only when it's necessary.  i'm feeling incredibly capable of holding my own and that alone reduces stress.

another aspect is the setting: i'm outside all day and i love it.  i also ride my bike to work in the morning and, this, i absolutely love.  it's just very free.  my last couple of jobs have been in a warehouse and a factory, which are not so pleasant.  it's relaxing for me to hear birds and feel breezes.

lastly, the social aspect seems to reduce stress for me.  it's customer service so i spend a lot of time face to face with people.  another difference from line work with order scanners instead of human contact.  if those jobs were de-humanizing, this job is re-humanizing.

For the past ~3 months i have been studying without an ounce of entertainment or relaxation. due to various reasons my schoool started out late and i had to cover my entire syllabus in less amount of time. I had to pull allnighter for several days. while the other days, i slept only for 3-4 hours. I think this has badly affected my mental health. My parents always tell me to not strain yourself too much, but I am anxious and scared about my grades.

Apparently i think i could perform only average on all of my tests this year. im 11th grader and im seriously anxious about my grades.

Now this is not the real problem at hand. I have strained myself too much to an extent that I cant feel anything anymore. I have completely lost interest in scoring good grades, instead all I want is now is to finish the tests and sleep peacefully if its possible. Still i dont think its possible bc after the exams, I would be pretty anxious and i cant stand it anymore. I have an headache everytime i feel distressed and I feel the urge to sleep.

I tried reading some books and watching movies, I couldn't feel anything. Like if i tried reading a book, I will read it and probably feel nothing. My mind is elsewhere and I dont even know what im reading. Same goes for movies and other entertainment. I scroll through reddit or youtube hoping to find some fun, but its depressing too. Yet I still continue to do it.

How do I save myself from this pithole. tbh im writing this post with a headache and im sleepy as hell, please forgive me if there is any mistakes. Also I need to study for day after tomorrow's exam...",Stressed

488,"Feeling pressured by my spouse to remain in therapy  I've been seeing a talk therapist for a number of years now. Like most therapists (I believe) she practices a fluid mixture of modalities. I would have preferred to have seen a CBT specialist but ... I couldn't find one in my area.

We've made a lot of progress in helping me navigate my tumultuous relationship with my toxic/abusive/narcissistic mother and family. However, life has followed on with its bumps in the road and I've repeatedly lapsed back into depression.

Over the course of the past year and a half I've also been working with a psychiatrist to try to treat my energy/focus/motivation issues from a medication standpoint too. Recently, I started taking Lexapro.

My feeling, right now, is that I've reached the end in terms of how much help therapy can offer me. I'm sick of talking about my relationship with my mom and no matter how many times I try to cojole my therapist into talking about the future she returns the conversation to that.

I also strongly believe that, right now, my depression is chemical. And that finding the adequate dose of an antidepressant is going to be key to getting me out of this rut. Right now, every day is somewhat challenging. But I hope that I'll soon start to lift out of this place. And that staying there will be the next objective.

Finally, the ongoing cost of therapy is posing a major strain on my finances which are already strained from job-related difficulties. This has been a stressor for as long as I've been going to a therapist. And I feel that adding stressors to your life is kind of counterproductive to the objective of getting mentally well!

My wife insists that I need to be in therapy for as long as I feel down and offers to borrow money from her parents to held cover the costs but ... my gut instinct is telling me that it's not helping and that I just don't need or want any more of it.

Is it okay to be 'done' with therapy? I've felt like it served a purpose but that my future recovery is going to come from other directions.

493,"How to decrease self pressure?  Hi friends, 
I struggle with putting too much pressure on myself. This realization came as I reflected on my summer and pretty much most of 2020. When the state wide shut down happened, I lost a lot. My internship, gone. Volunteering, seized. I was forced to move back home away from campus. Then I struggled to find a job. Much of my skills weren‚Äôt applicable to what was available at the time. I felt so useless. I couldn‚Äôt contribute much to anything. It was bad. 

But the flip side was that my feelings were all internal. No one made me feel bad except me. My family were supportive. My boyfriend was supportive. Literally everyone was in the same boat. I mean luckily my fam and bf were still employed working from home. I loved w bf and he essentially provided the entire period (rent and food). Perhaps having a man provide was foreign to me. Growing up seeing the mom do it all was my home. So to feel dependent on my bf during that time felt very weird to me.

Clonidine has been a godsend.

Clonidine on the other hand has no narcotic effect but is extremely effective at helping me go to sleep and it doesn‚Äôt feel much stronger than melatonin, you just feel a very normal sleepiness. The only noticeable side effect is that it‚Äôs a little more difficult to get out of bed. 

It‚Äôs used frequently for people who are withdrawing from sedatives like opioids, alcohol and benzos, as well as sedative psych meds like Seroquel. It helps people in withdrawal sleep with few side effects and can be taken during the day to help relief withdrawal anxiety.

When I‚Äôm met with conflict, specifically with my husband, I panic, get frantic, and crumble abnormally. It drives both of us insane.

It took hours for me to calm down and eventually I just passed out, I never really deescalated. I woke up feeling horrible. This has happened before but this time it was so so so magnified I guess due to hormones.

For context, I've been working on a Youtube channel where I do covers for a certain style of songs using the voice of a specific character. I've rebuilt this character's voice from the ground up, invested over a thousand hours building a super intricate system to be able to make any cover quickly and efficiently, taught myself the ins and outs of music from nothing, software tricks that are honestly pretty clever (I've never seen anyone bring them up when I've asked, they'd always tell me 'Oh I've never thought of that).

And then some random person out of nowhere draws animations of anime girls in skimpy clothing and reaches 110k subscribers in 2 months. Fine, their success is earned, I won't fault them for it - maybe they put in just as much effort learning to draw as I have developing my own craft.

500,"Feelings of failure - life pressures  Hi Everyone, I'm feeling in the mood to share. I'm hoping it will help me but better yet, it might help someone else as well.

I'm 34, married to a beautiful partner and we have two boys (4 and 2). I have a good job and am generally in good health. We own our own home and are in a comfortable financial position.

Everything sounds good right? Well that's where this thing called life comes in to the equation. 

Every so often I feel like a complete failure. I feel like the pressure of fatherhood and life is too much and I withdraw. Occasionally I might stay back at work really late and not communicate well about my whereabouts. I almost just need an escape. Sometimes I drink too much to escape too. For a long time I thought my wife, who would be upset by this, just didn't understand that I was not coping and really didn't understand or care about me. But the truth is I didn't understand that I was hurting her and I did a bad job of communicating with my wife about how I was feeling or directed myself to a more constructive outlet. 

I've become a bit worse with this in the last six months, ever since we found out that our two year old has been diagnosed with Kidney disease. It's been really hard and the idea of my little boy not being ok just breaks my heart. I don't have a mum or dad myself or any brothers or sisters. My kids and my wife mean the world to me and I fear what will come of me if I lose them. 

The worst part was the realisation that I was not respecting my wife and that she might have felt that I was deliberately trying to hurt her with this behaviour. This realisation is powerful but in some ways I just feel worse - how can I get this so wrong without even understanding why?

I didn't understand this very well until just recently. Why I was behaving the way that I am and how I was feeling. Again, those thoughts of failure overwhelmed me. But I am also trying to be compassionate to myself. I think there are many many people in this thread and life doing it much tougher than me. All I can say is that you are not alone and you are not a failure. I guess we are all works in progress and we try to make the best of the situation we all find ourselves in. 

There are things that we have the power to change. Perhaps not dwelling in the past and just being in the moment. Getting help and forgiving ourselves for any failures - not excusing the things that we can or want to change but just being kind. 

Anxiety and depression is a lot sometimes. 

Look after yourselves and love yourselves. I'm not really good at telling or doing this myself and I guess many here are in the same boat.

I am going to try and keep this short and sweet.

currently my girlfriend/family is pressuring me to take Seroquel/Zoloft. I previously took these meds back in my junior-senior year of high school and got off of them once I graduated. I was diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression since I was a kid. I did notice when I was a kid I did a lot of things for attention and for people to care about me like fake a suicide attempt or act depressed. Truly, I believe I have anxiety since I used to have mild anxiety, chronic panic attacks and depression throughout high school But i noticed when I left high school everything calmed down a lot. I do like to drink quite a bit because it makes me feel great and yes I know it is an anti-depressant.. 

I just got out of jail I was in county for 2 months because of some DUI's i got when this whole pandemic started. I still drink as I have been learning how to control my alcohol better... anyways I feel my girlfriend causes a lot of stress/anxiety/depression because we live together but we fight a lot and not only that but she always thinks I am cheating or she says I don't care about her. I have girl friends I occasionally talk to and she always says its either her or them. I don't really want to choose because I have no friends as it is and I don't feel like I have to choose as I am loyal and the girls that I am friends with respect the boundaries. Yes, I have done bad things but haven't we all? I am trying to address my anger problems as well.

We ourselves do not care too much about this as we believe hard work alone matters. 

He does a lot of things well - piano, math, etc. However, he has a low tolerance to stress. For example, he plays chess well but if he is playing with another player his own age he starts wilting. He cries and says ""undo the move"" if he loses a piece. If his teacher gives him a puzzle, if he is not the one to solve he gets upset. He plays piano well but in front of others he always plays worse.

We have told him many times that being imperfect is ok. Failing is ok. Making mistakes is ok. Losing a game is ok. He does not have to be the best or prove himself. It does not translate into anything meaningful.

516,"itching/tingling/pressure feeling beneath my skull when I'm anxious, experiencing a lot of rage, or severely depressed?  I haven't felt this sensation in a little while thankfully due to being in a lot better of a place than I was months ago when I was experiencing this last, but I've definitely experienced it quite a few times and it always seems to come with extreme mood states. It almost always presents as a tickling/itching sensation seemingly in my brain on the top of my head, or it will present as feeling like there's an invisible vice squeezing on my temples. The common theme seems to be at times when I would feel helpless.

How do you generally deal with intensive stress?
I need a little help. You see, because of the virus, we were in school for only about one month and I will be graduating this year. My field has this long-term project in which we search for external work (like Chemistry, Physics, Biology, ect.) and work on it for about two years.
I was working on it for said two years, but I was measuring and writing down data.
The thing is, I only have the introduction, I have to study for the finals and it's taking its toll on me. I feel extremely anxious when I'm not studying, I can't sleep, I don't want to eat and my dad is acting as if I was sitting on my butt the whole time. Our teacher should have sent us some tips about how to write said work, but didn't send anything. It's supposed to have 20 to 30 pages and I don't know how to do anything. 
My parents aren helping me either with stress, mom yells at me for everything and wants me to move out and as I said, my dad thinks I do nothing and said that they will not accept me on any university and that I'll fail, because supposedly there either smart and rich or poor and stupid  people.
He acts as if I won't graduate at the first try, I'm useless, because of course we can't fail.
I just want to breathe and be okay, but if I won't be able to graduate, I'm useless for this society and I can go dig myself a grave or jump out of the window.
Please just tell me what to do.

While my parents pushed me to the my best even though my efforts are already 100% considering my situation, I felt more down. Nowadays, they kept on saying things that irritates me. It concerns my future career but I wanted not to focus on it. I want to do nothing. I asked them if I can stop for a semester or a year maybe but they disregard that idea easily.

523,"Dealing with financial pressures even when doing relatively well and an annoying MIL.  I‚Äôm relatively well paid ($130-140k a year) and extremely frugal. My wife has just started working (she‚Äôll get $90k and spends like a typical Californian). We‚Äôre both 32. I‚Äôm a recent immigrant (2020) and was completing a PhD before I moved, hence I had no retirement savings. As a result, I feel pressure to max my retirement accounts (401k and IRA), which I‚Äôm currently doing. My wife has student loan debts ($49k, no accrual of interest until end of Jan and then 5.41%), but I‚Äôve saved up income from my job to cover the full $49k, with an extra $13k emergency fund (currently working on getting this back above $20k). We also have a 13 month old, who has $6-7k saved between a UTMA and a 529. We also have approximately $30k in a taxable brokerage that I have no plans to sell. I should be really happy with this progress, but I‚Äôm just letting things get to me. Finances were much simpler when I was concentrating on surviving and building an emergency fund on less than $2k a months pay.

Part of the issue is pressure on my wife from my mother-in-law. We need a new car (bad timing, but we‚Äôll be without a car in November otherwise - borrowed from a relative who now needs it back) and I‚Äôm in favour of spending only what we can re-save by January (or less). This would put us in the $20-30k range, which buys a nice 2018/19 car with low mileage. There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôll go above that range, because I‚Äôm not an idiot. My mother-in-law is in my wife‚Äôs ear saving I should get a Lexus or Tesla. She keeps making comments to my wife about me being poor and tight with money. She basically just wants to say her daughter drives a Lexus or Tesla to her friends, and she‚Äôs half convincing my wife. 

She also makes comments about me not saving enough for my daughter, which is fairly ironic as a big chunk of my earnings is going to pay off the student debt of her daughter that she didn‚Äôt save for. She also makes comments about my wife going back to work because I‚Äôm not a good provider, which is again ironic as I supported my wife not working for a year, whilst she sent her kids abroad to be looked after whilst she worked (a couple of months after giving birth). I guess all of the expectations are just getting to me. Don‚Äôt even want to start thinking about a house until we have no debts and $250k.

My solution is to just temporarily put saving for my daughter to the side (she‚Äôll still get $3k a year from my parents and bits from other people) until we have no debts, a car, $20k+ in an emergency fund, $20k in Series I bonds and any other likely big expenses covered. This will likely be around April (bonus/tax-return time). I then plan to start to save a minimum of $200 a month for my daughter, which I‚Äôll backdate to the point I stopped contributing as soon as I can afford to. She should have more than enough for in-state or UK fees (she‚Äôs a dual citizen) by the time she‚Äôs 18 if we do this, hopefully with basic living expenses mostly covered too.

We‚Äôll both be contributing fully towards retirement for the whole time, which will equate to just over $60k a year (including matches). I‚Äôll likely get a lot of grief (from mother-in-law and her gaggle of relatives/friends), but I believe that it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for my family. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs causing me a lot of stress and it‚Äôs annoying how she‚Äôs trying to make me feel like a failure, even though we‚Äôre doing financially better than my MIL and her husband did until they were around 50.

I also had a muscle tear recently, so I‚Äôve been unable to workout (one of my main stress relievers). This has definitely played a huge part in the stress, as well as feeling ganged up on by people who seem more concerned about a social status purchase over quickly building a strong financial base for my family. My family/friends are all abroad and they stay out of other people‚Äôs business. Add to that the fact she constantly says she can‚Äôt understand me because I can‚Äôt speak English (I‚Äôm from England), she constantly belittles me and she tries interfering with my daughter Skyping with my parents (1-2 hours on a weekend - comments like my daughter‚Äôs bored of them) and she gets to see her whenever she wants. She also laughed at my parents for not having degrees (almost nobody in my area does nowadays, never mind back in the 70s - they‚Äôre very successful financially) and cried when we gave my daughter my surname instead of hers (my wife and I both 100% agreed on that). Her kids all have the father‚Äôs surname‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm also apparently scrawny and weak (6ft5 and 225 lbs) and stupid (PhD in chem bio and MSc in mathematics). There‚Äôs definitely some deep rooted jealousy that I ‚Äústole her daughter‚Äù, as she‚Äôs used that phrase many times and she sees my daughter only as ‚Äúher granddaughter‚Äù. We live in the same state and have a spare room that she spends 50% of her time in, yet somehow it‚Äôs harder for her than my parents because they never see my daughter so they can‚Äôt miss her as much (her logic).

So I am a final year undergrad student with a low GPA, no job, no girlfriend, very few friends, social media addict, porn addict, basically the worst of all.

I've wasted 10 months of lockdown talking to this girl who I started really liking but we're just close friends and while we still talk daily, she is NOT into me.

But here's the thing, without social media and with barely anyone to talk to, I often find myself alone with my thoughts, thinking about my situation. 

My primary goal right now is to get a job (which is impossibly difficult given my grades). It will take 3 months of intense hardwork in isolation, but I am afraid I will lose my personality and turn into a loner who stays shut in all day with no social skills.

I every day feel like anything that I do is appreciated, like I am doing my best for nothing. I everyday feel like I don't have energy to do nothing, a constant idea of ""why should I do it if no one is gonna care"". I tried to get my family to bring me to a doctor, but everyone refuses to try to see if my consistent feeling of sleepyness and my constant bad mood and lack of energy is about something wrong with me, they just insist in that I'm just lazy and I don't wanna do anything. I have been told a lot of times the ""just do it for you"" thing. Yeah that sounds good. but it's hard when you have people on your back looking at you with a ""you're going to fail and we're gonna yell at you that you don't work, and if you do well we're not going to care"" at all times.

Also, when I do something good, no one even makes a question about how it was. But when I fail, I get yelled at because of ""slacking off and never studying"" even if I have studied 4 hours at home. Because of that, every time I have a coming test or grade, I get really nervous, in a really bad mood, I have problems to keep concentrated, and my head ""yells"" me a lot of things at the same time like ""you didn't do enough"" or ""you're gonna fail, you're useless""

533,"Under pressure to feel better for other people  I (29F) live with two friends (24F + 21M) and my long distance partner (25fluid).
We each have our mental health struggles and for the most part we just sort of deal with them. We all support each other through the rough times and celebrate the joyful times as good friends should.

My partner spends most of the time away working at the moment so it‚Äôs most often just 24F, 21M and I at home, and because of the age gap I have somewhat reluctantly taken on the matriarchal role of the household. 

When I‚Äôm well, I don‚Äôt mind mothering my friends so much, I care about them and want them to be happy healthy and thrive, so I offer what I can in the way of advice, counselling and just general experience of how the world works.

When I‚Äôm mentally unwell however, things change. 24F in particular is SOO impressionable (scarily so) that whatever mood surrounds her, she will absorb and somehow feel herself. I understand that this is common to a degree, surround yourself in happy vibes, things seem brighter, surround yourself in darkness and things seem more somber yada yada... but her level of impressionability (if that‚Äôs a word) is such that all it takes is for one person in her life to feel a certain way and suddenly she‚Äôs right there with them. I can‚Äôt even chalk it up to over empathising because she‚Äôs so na√Øve to how others get from trigger to emotion. Her theory of mind is fine, she just needs help connecting the dots between stimulant and reaction sometimes. I think if it was about overempathy then she would be able to see that connection more easily than most.

Anyway for context, I have Bipolar Disorder II, which means my moods can be all over the place, my reactions to situations can be way out of proportion and because I‚Äôm
not yet correctly treated for it, I‚Äôm unable to control or often see the warning signs of a mood change coming. 

This last 2 weeks has been very telling. Last week I was hypomanic, meaning I was full of energy, confidence, motivation, creativity, didn‚Äôt sleep, barely ate, and made rash, impulsive decisions. A couple of days ago I began to experience the inevitable crash I‚Äôve come to expect from those highs and I‚Äôm now in a depressive slump (which isn‚Äôt helping how negatively I feel about this particular situation).

While I was on cloud 9 last week she was right there with me, giggling, singing, telling excited stories about nothing and generally being more active than usual. (Kind of like when you rile up a puppy and suddenly they‚Äôre REALLY EXCITED but they‚Äôre not sure why)

These last couple of days on my mood crash, I‚Äôve watched her crash with me, become demotivated, quiet and isolating herself not just from us but from her online friends and boyfriend, with whom she would normally be on the phone for hours at a time every day.

When I‚Äôve been low in the past, she hasn‚Äôt dragged herself down with me, instead she‚Äôs tried harder to lift the energy in the house with music, food, jokes, games, or allowed me my moping time by covering me with a blanket and piling my favourite plushies on top of me. Her and 21M both look after me so well and so thoughtfully, which is why I was so surprised with her reaction to this mood episode and crash being so different.

It‚Äôs much more difficult for me to lift myself back up to a stable mood state if there‚Äôs so little positivity around me to grab on to. I can‚Äôt be the supportive matriarch everyone looks to for help while I‚Äôm unwell, I‚Äôm struggling to deal with my own stuff.
It feels like it‚Äôs all on me to lift the house‚Äôs spirits and I just can‚Äôt right now. That‚Äôs a lot of pressure and being unable to provide what‚Äôs become expected of me only helps me feel like a failure and pushes my depressive state deeper.

I know she sees me as a role model (though don‚Äôt fully understand why, I am so far from having my shit together that it‚Äôs not even funny anymore) but this does feel like an unhealthy copycat thing. 

I don‚Äôt want to believe she‚Äôs faking this reaction to align with me but that has happened before. Before we moved in together, she used to fake passing out several dozen times a day (only when with us though) and she called it panic attacks. As both a trained counsellor and a genuine sufferer of panic attacks, I was very close to cutting ties with her altogether over it. Long story short, I told her to buck up or fuck off, and she bucked up instantly. Despite me including it in this post, I genuinely don‚Äôt hold any grudge about that because she immediately admitted her wrongdoing, apologised and we all moved on like adults. That said, it does leave me wondering...

Maybe I‚Äôm just being narcissistic in assuming her genuine mood changes have anything to do with mine, I really do hope that‚Äôs the case.

Somewhere between childish mimicking, impressionable na√Øvet√© and honest emotions there‚Äôs a truth I‚Äôm too afraid to ask for. If she‚Äôs really feeling so bad, the last thing I wanna do is suggest she‚Äôs faking. But if she‚Äôs faking, why should I tolerate that? And if she thinks she feels bad just because somebody else is feeling bad... I can‚Äôt live with that. That kind of mirroring of my most destructive emotions is toxic, whether she‚Äôs doing it intentionally or not. 

Oh look I‚Äôve gone off on a novel again, sorry üòê 

TL;DR
Think my housemate could be mirroring my bipolar mood states but too scared to ask in case she‚Äôs genuine. It‚Äôs too hard to fight my own demons if there‚Äôs only darkness and negativity at home but I feel like it‚Äôs on me to brighten the mood.",Stressed
534,"Mom is pressuring me to be something great.  edit: sorry if weird flow or format. on mobile and kind of a rant

My mother has always wanted me to go to a pretentious university and was very upset when I decided to go to a ""non target"" school. She's pressuring me to transfer to a name school, but she's emphasizing how she wants it to be my choice. I don't  want to transfer. She will be  furious if I dont. She said that even if I try to transfer, the only way I'll get rejected is if I don't wish for the transfer to happen. 

She was lecturing me about how I'm ""not normal"" and how I'm better than everyone else. She wants me to be a CEO at 30 that makes a couple mil a year (her brothers gf). She has never been happy with my marks (80s) and has always said how I have the potential but I just never try. She tried to control my friends and wants me to only make friends with people who are ""at my level or above"".Her values don't match up to mine at all. She's super anti LGBTQ (I'm straight but an ally), anti mental illness (believes it's a gross contagious illness), and puts marks and ranking above everything. I feel suffocated every time I'm around her but she has no friends or husband and stresses ""family time"". As she was lecturing me today, I started ""cutting"" myself with a sharp tool. It only broke skin and no blood but I feel myself sinking. It distracted me from her words and the implication that she was disappointed in me 

She has also always had a problem with my weight. I used to be pretty skinny but now, Ive gained a small muffin top (I'm 5'5 and 120lbs). She constantly pokes fun at my weight and tells me to go to the gym, ""for my own good"". I mentioned that my friend with depression is going to the gym to help their mental health and she immediately backtracked and said that I shouldn't work out for mental health. She then said that I should stop hanging out with said friend as it was ""infecting me with the disease"". She says that I should get a routine for going to the gym for my own good since all the CEOs do it, but that has worsened my motivation.

My dilemma is, what do I do with my mental state? I'll try to transfer (but I'm 99% sure I won't get in). I don't want to talk with my mom about it, because she will definitely not change and is only wording it to sound like it's all my choice. 

I've considered therapy. I've had slight ""abuse"" from my dad that my mom brushes off and commitment issues due  to my dad's cheating  and divorce. I've considered therapy but my friends said that therapy is useless and for the weak (quote). I guess I just wanted to rant. It could be worse.

I was developing anxiety and the pace of how the lessons were going was making it worse since I couldn't catch up. one of my teachers saved my ass by convincing the school to let me do summer school instead since I only had 1 quarter left and I would've passed. most of my teachers made me pass since I did well on their subjects so I only had to do science and math for the summer. this year I was breaking down again. I tried going to a psychiatrist and I also unluckily had amoebiasis and shitty chronic headaches. I visited the doctors and had medical certificates to tell them it was a legit reason. but my school informed me that I had to transfer, and that broke me so much I decided to transfer to online schooling.

I eventually grew up to be good at English and history and am frequently relied on by my classmates for reports and I even found a bit of love for math when I got good at a bit of it. then I went back to hating everything (but history although I don't like philosophy because there were too many names but little story).I'm not sure if this is the place to post this but I think it heavily affected my mental health.

539,"Does anyone else feel pressure to make up for lost time?  I was wondering if anyone has felt similarly, and how/if they've been able to cope with these feelings if they have: 

I'm 27 years old. I've struggled with depression and PTSD for a long time due to childhood abuse and bullying. I've been out of the abusive environment for 10 years now and have been getting better but it's been a slow process. Mental illness and learning to cope with ADHD also played a role in me needing an extra 2 years to finish undergrad. It's been 2 years post university and I've hit a wall when it comes to trying to start working on long-term goals or projects, like applying for grad school, learning things like languages or musical instruments, etc. 

Every time I try to start on those things I immediately feel stressed because I'm afraid I'm not working on it fast enough, or that I need to get everything done super fast, or that it's going to take too long to see results. My therapist has told me that I shouldn't feel like I have to get all my goals/projects done in one year or a matter of a few months, and that it's unrealistic to try and get things done faster, but I have problems pacing myself because I feel like I've got to make up for the years I lost dealing with mental health and abuse. Like I need to shove three years into every year now to make up for lost time. 

The problem is that I get overwhelmed with trying to undertake too many things at once, in part because of my ADHD, or I'm overwhelmed at the stress I mentioned above. And then I end up not working on anything and more time goes by that I feel I need to make up for. So it turns into a cyclical thing, and has been feeding into my pre-existing stress and depression.",Stressed

But men also face a lot of pressure because of their gender and it is barely brought forward.  I am speaking as a male here so I cannot fully understand the perspective of the average female even though I can empathise with their daily struggles.

Yes, I understand that women had it tough - gender roles, wage differences because of their gender, gender expectation, etc.

Yes, we males have more privileges or are looked up to even more, or some of us abuse our privileges for personal gain,

But very rarely do we ever feel the pressures, the challenges and even the dangers of being a male. And yes, I do mention that there are a lot.

The pressure to be strong, physically and mentally, to be smart, to be successful, to be kind to everyone especially females, to have a plan, to take care of everyone, to be a role model, to know how to handle pressure, to know how to woo a woman, etc.

Heck, males are also victims of other things too like abuse or rape and that is being mentioned or att worst, it is often used as a joke in fictional media.

And I can say this as a male who has also been bullied and abused and I still sometimes find it hard to address my experiences or accept them and accept my feelings because I am supposed to be a man.

I'm going to CEGEP which is a kind of equivalent to college. I don't want to go back even if there's not so much time left to the term (it ends in two weeks). I can't stand the community transports but, worst of all, I can't stand social requirements and all. I hate being around people a lot. I also hate the pressure I have. I study music and it's really demanding since I need to practice a lot. I do not practice enough. Also, I do have some hallucinations. I have weird episodes where everything becomes horrible and gigantic. It's like everything was too much. I am hypersensitive in my senses and it gets worse when I get these crisis. I thought about changing program for something which requires less practice, like psychology. It seems I'm loosing a lot of time having problems of many kind. Also, not only do I loose time but I'm also ruining my grades and that's really bad too. I hope there's still a positive future ahead of me... Also, I can't sleep since many time there's a dark force in my room that spikes, me, breathes and my ears and tell me bad things. He rarely speaks though. I'll be seeing a psychiatrist next month because my therapist sees my state isn't so good. I don't know how I can get there though, every day is tougher and every week I skip classes to stay home.

552,"Feeling like a failure. Anxiety and pressure and 5 years since school  bunch of teachers and some people who I spoke to in school and some friends who I see keep in to contact with (like 4). Never really someone with friends ever and have even less nowadays. 

If you list out what I have done/ see my cv you would think oh that‚Äôs pretty impressive. Uni and a masters some internships. But the reality is I barely made it through my undergrad and it probably destroyed my mental heath as I was on my own. It wasn‚Äôt for me I hated it and had no friends and friends from school were thousands of miles away on a different continent. which was not where ‚Äòhome‚Äô really was as I went to boarding school so It was like I get to see them at Xmas or summer anyways. It was probably too far of a change/ out of my comfort zone and I basically had to struggle with it for 4 years. I finished that and was like I tried to apply for some jobs but didn‚Äôt get anywhere and applied to grad school in a field which was related and needed a masters for. And a chance to move back to a place near where I went to school. 

Fast forward to the present I handed in my dissertation a month ago and have been applying unsuccessfully for jobs in my field since last October. My parents have been forcing/ putting pressure on me to get a job especially a part time one. Yes it‚Äôs part time like barista jobs but for me that is my worst nightmare and I am stressed out as it is applying for jobs. And getting less and less clear on what I want because I am getting no where, I have had 3 job. Interviews all unsuccessful. 

So this reunion has mostly made me seem like even more of a failure because I have no job. Literally no friends or social skills. Small talk I can‚Äôt Handle, it just felt awkward and repeating I was in X for uni then was back here for a masters which I finished last month... then was sat for the meal with a teacher I like never talked to in school it got awkward fast and we are at the end of the table.... my friends on the other side have complicated issues with others there and had some awkward moments. Which resulted in leaving early. 

That school was everything to me I may have not been ‚Äòpopular‚Äô or have many friends but I felt like I had a support system there. My parents have never really been the best at that and have made me feel like shit when I fail which is why when I do struggle I never tell them because of their reaction. There was a teacher who When in school I opened up to about like the pressure of my parents in my final two years of school. She was my teacher since I started there and  knew me and that I did struggle with the process of getting to things even though I would get there or knew it already. I saw her when visiting during my first year at uni and I burst into tears and told I was struggling with the adjusting. And when I saw her this weekend I was just brought back to that moment and was in tears again. She reminded me that I had survived and that I had gotten through those tough times. And she had been following an account which I keep for current stuff in my field which is the subject which she teaches. Although I was still kinda in tears just hearing that makes me feel less of a failure. Especially as she knows what I have been through and I guess what I have been capable of in a teacher way which my parents would never get. 

5 years and I feel like I have gotten no where, I just about made it though uni and grad school which still not 100% sure that I passed because stress levels on that dissertation were record high and late and supervisor had only seen about 10% before submission because of the previous reasons. My mental health was alright 5 years ago but now it‚Äôs really not. I feel like I have self inflicted anxiety from kinda isolating myself in first year and not really making friends either. Just had people I knew around and talked to in lectures. 

I just hate this unknown and do want a job just not a temporary retail customer direct job serving food or coffee which ‚Äònormal‚Äô people would find easy and ‚Äòpeople without a degree‚Äô can do. Everyday where I don‚Äôt have a job I‚Äôm filling out a job application taking way longer than one would think needs to answer a question about what I have done or write a cover letter or my parents asking if I applied to that coffee shop or a part time place the pressure and failure has just been increasing. When I wasn‚Äôt even finished with my dissertation and at all time high level of stress. My dad when we walked through the local shops area made me take a photo of every since job advert we walked past that just there was just the tipping point of the increasing pressure and sense of failure from them. They have been not in the same city for this month but yesterday my mum who is joe retired is here for 3 weeks for the sole reason of ‚Äúhelping‚Äù but she is 1000% worse of making me feel like a failure and repeating all my failures to me and every chance.",Stressed

555,"Being in nature reduces stress and blood pressure - but crucially also stops us ruminating on the past and future  Spending time in nature makes a huge difference to our mental health; research has shown it can decrease our stress levels, reduce our heart rate and reduce our blood pressure - but one of the most interesting effects it has is to reduce how much we ruminate, how much we attach ourselves to our thoughts.

When we get swept away by our thoughts and lose touch with the present moment, suffering isn‚Äôt far behind. Being lost in the past and future drives a great deal of our sadness and anxiety. Where nature is incredibly powerful is in its ability to focus our attention, taking us out of our heads and into our surroundings via our senses.

And aside from all that, it takes us away from the information bombardment for a little while, away from our work and our phone and the TV. So when we give our full attention to a bird that's landed on a tree or take the time to look at the different parts of a flower we‚Äôre giving a minds a break and bringing ourselves back to the only place we can be happy - here and now.

558,"My suicidal friend has put a lot of pressure on me to help them, and I don't think that I can.  For a long time now, I have been supporting someone (let's call them Al) with severe mental health issues. I haven't known them that long, but I considered them to be one of my closest friends, and wanted to do anything to make them feel better. I still do, but it has been consistently draining my mental health, and, after talking to some people and family that I've known much longer, I realised my friendship with Al had become incredibly toxic.

At first, it was just me pushing Al to talk to me and rely on me more. It wasn't someone else expecting me to help them or 'save' them: it was all me. And that was fine (not necessarily healthy, but I know that now).

When they told me they were suicidal, amongst many other mental health issues, I did everything in my power to be there for them, even if it meant jeopardizing my own mental health. 
I would answer messages immediately. I would stay up to ungodly hours calming Al down. I would endure their angry comments directed at me, excusing it due to how they were feeling. I encouraged them to get further help, but they weren't ready. I showed them tons of resources and did as much as I could to make them smile.

This is when things started getting really toxic, on both our parts.

When I was spending time with others, I would drop everything to answer calls, and be made to feel bad or guilty if I did not answer or tell Al that I had gone somewhere. I had woken up to many missed calls before and I felt blamed for potential suicide attempts. 
If I was shown as active online but was not responding, I was told I didn't care, and accused of not being a real friend.
I was told I was the only person who cared, and this led to me putting further pressure on myself, as I was all they had. Without me, what would happen? When people told me to stop and look after myself, I got angry at them. What if Al died? And it would be my fault, just because I wanted to sleep one night? I would happily sacrifice that one night's sleep if it meant Al would be okay. And this mentality led to little to no sleep at all, and little to no time to myself.
I felt entirely responsible for this person's actions, and began to feel anxious whenever I was on my phone or online, in case Al saw I was not responding straight away (because of my nerves about the whole situation, I would often need time to calm down). 

Eventually my other friends made me realise how unhealthy this all was, and that this actually isn't what friends are for. I took a step back. I am actually getting sleep now, and I'm trying to look after myself. We still talk and I try to help when I feel capable of it, but I am still being told it's not enough and still being indirectly accused of not caring.

The anxiety of something actually happening to Al still gets to me, and I have constant inner conflicts about whether I'm a good person and friend. I keep telling myself I'm not a therapist, and if they need help, it will have to come from them and not from me. I have given them all the resources I know of. But there's still doubt.

Am I right in prioritising myself right now? I guess I just need to hear it from other people, perhaps people who have had similar experiences to me.

My dad is very very high risk. So I‚Äôve been trying my hardest to be careful. I‚Äôve been handling good, I‚Äôm not the partying type like my (just turned 20) sister or anything. I enjoy being on my own. (Even though sometimes I need to be with friends). So I decided not to go for a job until the pandemic and lockdown cools. I‚Äôm very much afraid of getting ill too. My sister doesn‚Äôt care. She‚Äôs the worst and this situation has brought the worst out of her. 

Anyway, I recently started applying for jobs and it‚Äôs going awful. I‚Äôm trying to find anything with childcare but everyone wants someone with a higher qualification and experience etc. But I apply and the worst thing is not getting a reply just to let me know I didn‚Äôt get it. I literally waited a month for an interview (they said they‚Äôll contact me for an interview at the end of the month). Nothing happened. I had my hopes up waiting. They could have just said I wasn‚Äôt what they were looking for or something. It‚Äôs exhausting. Like I just spent 2 hours filling in your stupid application, least you could do is say I didn‚Äôt get it. 

Then I have family friends/ my moms friends recommending jobs for me. So I‚Äôve been applying etc and not getting it. 

I‚Äôm at my wits end. So a family friend sent one. So I email for a form and I quickly scan through and I know I‚Äôm not getting it. I see what they are looking for and I know I‚Äôm not it. There‚Äôs loads of questions that basically repeat itself that I don‚Äôt know how to answer so I said to my mum I‚Äôm not doing it. I don‚Äôt care if I get a job in childcare. I‚Äôll happy enough to get a job in a shop. I don‚Äôt care anymore. 

Fine. That‚Äôs the end of it I thought. Nope. The friend told my mum that the one person who applied who‚Äôs qualified isn‚Äôt getting it. She on the panel and she didn‚Äôt want her as well. (Didn‚Äôt know she was on the panel). I thought well if it comes back around I might apply. Then my mum jumps on saying they are willing to hire someone who will work towards a level 3 (I‚Äôm a level 2) etc. I told her straight up, I have no interest in getting a level 3, I don‚Äôt want it, it takes a year to get and I don‚Äôt want to be there for a year. I don‚Äôt want a future in childcare, it‚Äôs a waste of time for me to get it. So, okay end of story. Nope

Next day, today, I get an email saying today‚Äôs the closing date, I was like whatever, not interested. I was excited for today, I was planning on cooking( about now if this didn‚Äôt all happen) I was going to have a good day. I actually woke up in a good mood too. The friend messaged my mum again saying how she wants me to at least send my cv in (I honestly don‚Äôt think she knows my qualifications etc). Saying how she‚Äôs talked me up. I was like fine. Just because she‚Äôs trying to help. So I sent my cv and said I‚Äôll send the application form in later. 

Crap. I start the application. Answer what I can. And it‚Äôs still half empty. I have gaps everywhere cause of my travelling. My grades aren‚Äôt the best either because I wasn‚Äôt trying to get into uni So I wasn‚Äôt too worried (stupid). Then I break down crying. I‚Äôm not going to get this. There‚Äôs not enough nepotism around for me to be close. I don‚Äôt want it. I don‚Äôt want to work towards the next level. I don‚Äôt want a permanent job. And the questions, again are impossible. I don‚Äôt know how to answer them. They clearly want people who know how to answer theses. 

So I tell my mum again. And she goes on and on. Saying how she can‚Äôt even help me cause it‚Äôs in a different language (I‚Äôm bilingual. My mum is not). I‚Äôm like I‚Äôm not asking for help. I can read it and I don‚Äôt know how to do it. She doesn‚Äôt work in childcare so she wouldn‚Äôt have been able to help. Then she goes, well just leave it blank. What‚Äôs the point. They‚Äôll see it‚Äôs blank and go to the next application because they wouldn‚Äôt have asked a question if they won‚Äôt people to skip it. 

Writing it out makes it seem less, but I‚Äôm so stressed out. There‚Äôs so much pressure on me and I can‚Äôt do it. All I wanted to do today was try a new recipe and have a good day. Because I feel so depressed lately, everything makes me feel worst, as if there are rocks in my chest. I‚Äôm not getting along with my sister at all!!!!! And I‚Äôm not where I won‚Äôt to be. Now my good mood has shattered and all I won‚Äôt to do is stay in bed, watch the same show I‚Äôve seen a hundred time and knit. 

I literally hate leaving the house now too. The first time I have in months and felt comfortable was to the craft store, where I knew it would be quiet and now that masks are mandatory. 

Also everyone is looking for jobs now who are way more qualified and experienced than me. I just feel like a colossal failure.",Stressed

571,"Possible hallucinations from OCD (can't find anything like it online)  Hi, I (M18) want to know if anyone knows anything about what I'm experiencing or has had a similar experience.

For context, I've been diagnosed with OCD and Bipolar disorder.

I am not sure if what I'm experiencing is related to OCD but I have a strong feeling it is because it's a compulsion. This is going to be very hard to explain but I will try my best. I can feel ‚Äúpressure‚Äù in inanimate objects and people. I can do it by looking at them or not, but I can feel it much better when I can see it or even see them in my peripheral vision. What I mean by this is that when I look at something, It feels like I'm applying physical pressure to that object or person. For example, let's say I'm doing it to an office chair with a mesh backrest like the one in my room. I can feel pressure though out the chair all the way from the top of the chair to the wheels and even into the floor. There is not limit to how large of an object I want to do it to, I can even do the entire earth. If the chair is thick I run diagonal lines through the width of the chair  and around all borders of the chair to ensure it receives equal pressure all around. I don‚Äôt feel the stimulation and pressure from my body, but rather from the chair as if I have another set of nerves within the chair. I do this to random objects and people thousands of times a day and it usually only takes half a second now that I‚Äôm good at it. I know it‚Äôs not real but I have to do compulsively which is why I think it‚Äôs linked to OCD.",Stressed

575,"Hello guys I have a question related to my childhood, if anybody of you guys wants to answer that would be very helpful! There is no pressure on anyone!  As children, are we supposed to tell our parents every time we get into trouble or if something bad happens to us? I'm 24, and everything before 2015 has gone wrong for me! When I was in school I was severely mentally and physically tortured by my classmates and batchmates, to the point where every coming day felt like another nightmare coming! The thing is, my parents always expected that if I have problems I am the one who is supposed to convey those problems to them! This makes me feel they didn't care enough to notice that I was in problems! Because of this I never told my parents anything about my problems! There was this time in 2017 where I had a massive panic attack after which I started crying and telling my mom everything that has happened to me in the past, but she just left after listening without saying anything! Even to this date, she hasn't talked to me about whatever I told her that day! This makes me believe they do not care enough! Now that I'm finally trying to let go of the past and come to terms with it, the only thing that is still hurting me is the fact that I think my parents never cared about me! I'm slowly accepting the mistakes that I have done in the past and I am also trying my best to understand why wrong things happened to me. I just want to understand, was it my fault I never shared anything with my parents or is it my parent's fault that they never noticed I was going through a rough phase when I was a child! I got diagnosed with ADHD in 2020, and in 2021 with anxiety-panic attacks, Schizophrenia and depression!

Afterwards, he told me he wanted to come on my face, and I said no to that, so he got himself off and finished on my chest (but he tried to aim for my face and I shoved him downwards.)

583,"The modern society is creating a high anxiety condition.  We live in a society with high anxiety as a consequence of social media; body image, sex, and other social expectations pressure, and our primitive brain's need for anxiety as a defense mechanism.

Social media platforms are part of our lives, allowing constant access to sharing a variety of information. However, they also contribute to anxiety by creating a culture of comparison, where people constantly compare their lives, achievements, and looks. The idealized versions of others' lives often shown on social media can make us feel inadequate and anxious about our own lives.

Society puts pressure on physical appearance, sexuality, and social status. The pressure to conform to these standards can be overwhelming and cause anxiety. Unrealistic beauty standards, sexual expectations, and the pursuit of material success can create a constant sense of inadequacy and anxiety about fitting in or meeting societal expectations.

Our primitive brain developed to protect us from threats and ensure survival, making it naturally prone to experience anxiety. It constantly scans the environment for potential dangers and triggers the ""fight-flight-or-freeze"" response when it senses a threat. While this response was crucial for our ancestors' survival, in modern society, it can be easily triggered by various factors, such as: social pressures. This constant state of arousal can result in anxiety and contribute to high anxiety levels in society.

In short, social media, societal pressures, and our primitive brain's defense mechanism all contribute to the high anxiety levels in our society. Recognizing these factors and adopting strategies to manage anxiety, like mindfulness, self-care, and seeking support, can help us navigate the challenges of living in an anxiety-inducing environment.

Current story: My wife is due to fly to a rehab clinic tomorrow. She left me a few weeks ago after losing her job (at first blaming me) and went on a bender and eventually hit rock bottom and called me for help. Although I was extremely angry with her for many things (and she had reason to be angry with me, I'm not playing ""who's worse"" here), I made vows. I flew to where she was. Although we've successfully gotten her to do intake interviews, etc, we've been fighting off an on. Nothing physical, but vicious verbal attacks (both comedians by training. it makes verbal attacks really, really bad). I also brought our dog for comfort, but we had to stay in a hotel b/c her temporary apartment won't allow it. The money stresses me out. When she's distressed she spends too much of it and it causes major resentment. I'm also angry about the way she talks to me, which makes me feel so inferior and stupid even though I don't think that's true (I'm doubting myself more and more though). I've become verbally abusive, which I learned from her. I had never even heard someone talk like that in a relationship, and now I'm worse because I'm a mimic by nature and I pick up people's speech patterns really quickly.

I'm filled with so much resentment from past wounds, and so is she. When we were apart we remembered that we loved each other, when we're together we remember how much we hurt each other. I feel incredibly cruel. The one thing I will say is that she's much better at making me feel guilt than I am, but I'm better at just hurting (verbally). Maybe because I'm actually worse, I don't know. 

I have a tendency to make horrible, horrible jokes when I'm super nervous. She wanted me to proof a thank-you letter to my mom for helping pay for rehab and I blurted out a racial slur in the middle of it (as if she had accidentally typed it‚Äîhilarious). I do feel like other times I get yelled at for really minor things and that she has no patience and nothing but disgust for me, but because my family can help pay she's forced to deal with me. Other times I think she still loves me.

She keeps telling me I'm insane and sick and delusional and have no grasp on reality. She's been saying this for years and now I believe her. I also retaliate verbally many times, often delayed.

I feel so horrible for being unable not to be serene around someone I'm trying to get to go to rehab (which has dragged out all week. I wanted her to just do the intake and go and fucking not worry about her dentist appointment or getting glasses or whatever but I say yes to everything). 

On top of this I work remotely. My job is on thin ice. I can't give her my full attention and I feel like she just doesn't think about the implications of that. On top of THAT I have major, major family events tonight and tomorrow. We fought this morning and I'm worried that while I attend those events she'll sabotage everything and drink or do drugs.

She has major, horrifying childhood trauma, and was raped as an adult by someone we both know (we reported it, but had to do so anonymously because we're in a tight-knit community. he was quietly driven out but the gossip machine would have been insane. Her decision to be anonymous, not mine). Frankly, dealing with her issues has exacerbated my underlying mental problems and I am about to snap.

Read if you want, only then. 
No coercion, it just creates pressure. 

Technique 1 of 3: against depression, fear, panic, hate, worry, doubt, grief, release tension physically (a little) and mentally (a lot). ""Short-term in case of acute need"" Immediately applicable. Hello, basically it's about the fact that each brain can only carry out a maximum of 4 senses at the same time. For example, thinking is a sense, as is hearing, feeling, seeing, estimating distance, estimating weight, and many more. You can take advantage of this and can be used at any time. ""Only"" the following 4 SENSES must be executed AT THE SAME TIME. Concentration is required! Possibly do technique 3 first to get better concentration. The more practiced you are, the easier it will be!!!
 1st sense: peripheral vision, that is, you look through your eyes without focusing on a point, as if you were looking into the distance, you don't see anything in detail, but you see everything that is in front of you. That goes inside and outside. Panoramic mode, if you will. 
2nd sense: hearing, hear everything there is to hear. Take in every sound. 
3rd sense: feel, feel into yourself, how do your hands, legs, chest, feet feel, everything there is to feel. 
4th sense: focus on your breathing, keep breathing naturally without changing anything. Feel the air go in and out. If you perform these 4th senses at the same time, you will automatically stop thinking (depression/anxiety, panic, anger, hate etc.) 
You can use this very valuable technique anytime, anywhere. You automatically get out of your head and you are in the here and now (present). You can maintain this state and distance yourself from the overwhelming situation. If the nagging thoughts come back apply the technique again, you can remain in this state as long as you like. You will automatically become ""Neutral"" in all respects. You can now decide again whether you want to stay in the present or ponder again (""eggs not laid"" that have not yet happened, worries, grief, etc.) <-> (future and past). If they're doing well or really well, they shouldn't do the technique and just enjoy it.


Technique 2 of 3: How to process recurring nagging thoughts (depression, chronic anxiety, panic attacks, insecurities, worries, etc.) in the long term. ""with system"" 

Step 1 Buy a blank notebook and write down every thought that bothers you. Really all. 

Step 2: If everything is in this book, look carefully! Can you think of what? What do you notice? A tip, probably all thoughts end with a question mark like this 

Step 3: Put the book in a safe place where you can access it at any time. You now have all the nagging thoughts in this book! From day to day your head becomes more and more calm because you have everything in order in the book in front of you and that gives you more serenity. You've probably already heard this effect from musicians who have processed their past into a song. But you will definitely learn more about yourself just because you have it in front of you in a clearer way! (Physically only limited but definitely something. Do you know the feeling when you are really scared and you automatically tense your shoulders, in your face (forehead) e.g., or pull your arms up. This technique definitely does not cause even more tension . )


 Technique 3 of 3: Stop obsessions (anxiety, panic, depression, compulsions, shame or embarrassment, worry, reproach, feeling helpless, etc.) Close your eyes and say: Imagine not a pink elephant. say again and again!!! By saying ""no elephant"" their mind automatically does the opposite. That's why it probably doesn't help if you think or say: think positively!!!!! contrary day.

hp Become aware that there are two voices (trains of thought) in your head. - One side is the mind, which doesn't get any further because there are too many unanswered questions for which you haven't found a solution yet. This distracts you with some trivial things like video games, drinking alcohol (especially beer, Google the medical effects of hops), or you provoke arguments with others, etc. Pondering can then upset your stomach, which can lead to loss of appetite . chain reaction. If the stomach does not receive nutrients, the body does not get the necessary energy to maintain the basic functions of the body due to the ""no starvation mode"". (Temperatures equalizing whether too warm or too cold, thinking etc.) It's a vicious cycle because it makes you shaky and makes you feel even worse. Her mind makes her restless, you drive yourself crazy with the open questions that the mind has. The mind gets stuck because they get stuck. Therefore try technique 2 ""possibly"" times, if you want. Coercion is counterproductive and inefficient. And make yourself aware that if you do Technique 2, you will not only learn something about yourself, but about everyone. We all worry/worry about the same ""shit"". That's why I can understand well how others are doing and can understand trains of thought because I have exactly the same. Only what makes us happy or anxious is totally different (a matter of taste), so please try technique 2. -On the other hand, our subconscious (also called soul, or spirit). Your subconscious, your guilty conscience, is probably always telling the truth. If we act against our conscience, it stresses us directly, like when I destroy 2 bars of nougat chocolate. You know what I mean. Balancing these two sides should actually be a top priority for everyone. (peace of mind) Peace‚ù§Ô∏è

593,"What Are the Top Challenges Facing Medical Healthcare Students Today?  Have you ever wondered what obstacles medical students face in order to pursue careers in medicine? Delving into the world of medicine is undoubtedly a noble pursuit, but it comes with its own unique set of challenges. From the relentless academic pressure to managing the emotional highs and lows of patient care, let's unravel the top issues that make the path to becoming a healthcare professional both rewarding and demanding.  
  
1. Academic Pressure:  
One of the foremost challenges is the intense academic pressure inherent in medical education. The vast volume of information, demanding coursework, and rigorous examinations can create a highly stressful environment. Balancing theoretical knowledge with practical skills adds an extra layer of complexity, often leaving students grappling with time management.  
  
2. Emotional Toll:  
Medical healthcare students frequently encounter emotionally charged situations, dealing with illness, suffering, and sometimes loss. The emotional toll of witnessing these aspects of human life can be overwhelming. Coping mechanisms and emotional resilience become crucial skills to develop, as maintaining empathy while preserving one's mental health is a delicate balance.  
  
3. Financial Strain:  
The cost of medical education, including tuition, books, and living expenses, can be exorbitant. Many students face the challenge of managing substantial student loans and financial strain, impacting their focus on studies and potentially contributing to burnout. Exploring financial assistance options and budgeting becomes essential for alleviating this burden.  
  
4. Work-Life Balance:  
Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is a perpetual struggle for medical healthcare students. The demanding nature of their studies and clinical rotations often leaves little time for personal lives, leading to exhaustion and potential burnout. Finding strategies to prioritize self-care and personal time becomes crucial for sustaining long-term success in the medical field.  
  
5. Competitive Residency Placements:  
Securing a desirable residency placement is a significant concern for medical students. The competition is fierce, and the process can be stressful. Students often grapple with the pressure to excel academically, gain relevant experience, and showcase their unique qualities to stand out in the highly competitive selection process.  
  
In summary, a medical healthcare student's path is characterized by obstacles that go beyond the classroom. Addressing these issues requires a combination of resilience, support systems, and strategic planning to foster success and well-being in the pursuit of a medical career.

602,"Family tensions.  [M23]

Hi, I‚Äôm pretty new to this page and quite honestly I just have a lot of bottled up tension with regards to my family that I want to let out. I thought why not share it i this page as I can hear from this community and see what I could do to support myself.

Me and my father do not get along, we have not seen eye to eye for the past 10 years now. We constantly argue, it can be the for the smallest thing and then it slowly develops. There have been several instances were it has developed into physical altercations and I don‚Äôt do well with fights (I don‚Äôt know how to fight, throw a punch etc).

We all live together (core family) so it‚Äôs pretty difficult to avoid any confrontations. I have spoken with my close friends about it and my relatives all know about it. But I stopped giving updates because nothing seems to change.

He would confront me about minor things such as why isn‚Äôt my room clean (I tidy my shit up), why haven‚Äôt I gotten a job (secured a job), why do I not talk to him (we have tried to do this this several times to no avail), and the worst part is him talking shit about me to my own relatives behind my back.

Most of the support I get is from my mother. I‚Äôll be graduating in a few weeks and he‚Äôs threatening to not bring my whole family to be there for me.

He makes my life horrible and I am counting the days that I get to move out. Just for reference, we come from a immigrant family but all the issues that stem have nothing to do with culture barriers.

It‚Äôs just poor communication, lack of willingness to listen. We could end up in the same house and not talk for months.

I want to cry, sometimes I want to end it all. I recently decided to pick up sports and continued my weekly running to let go of frustrations. I do have hobbies and i do have a routine to follow.

He is hellbent that I follow in his direction, in his words ‚Äòserve and respect me‚Äô. This year has been one of my worst years mentally and having such a strained relationship with my own household hurts even more. 

The worst thing for me is, I don‚Äôt think I will ever see him eye to eye. He also shows a huge partiality to my other siblings, always in close communication to them. I feel like an alien within my own family.",Stressed
603,"Psychosomatic symptoms in the form of chronic tension-type headaches (anyone else out there?)  Hi!

I am a 35 year-old male. I have been perfectly healthy and normal up until 2012-2013, when I burned myself out really badly. As I didn't listen to my body, it generated this insane tension-type headache (TTH), and only then was I forced to stop. So, the TTHs had a purpose initally: to stop me. 

Unfortunately, my tension-type headache got chronic and I have been suffering from it ever since 2012-2013 on a daily basis. Now it does not have a proper function but as it was activated 10 years ago it just did never go away. Now, it is just disabling me as it is triggered by any stress or fear. As a result I am on disability pension and my life is extremely limited. 

My TTH feels like a tight band is squeezing my head, which is just horrible. In addition, I usually also get irritated and noise-sensitive. I have been taking amitriptyline since 2019 as a preventive medication. It was very helpful in the beggining, but later the headaches were not prevented by amitriptyline that well. The initial dose was 100 mg per day. We increased the dose to 225 mg recently, and now the TTHs aren't as bad as before. I am just afraid that with time the TTHs will get worse again. 

Other medication: 80mg propral, 25mg ketipinor, 45mg Mirtazapin, lorazepam 0-3mg per day. 

Since the TTHs can be triggered by any stress or fear, there has developed a lot of weird triggers for the TTH. For instance, in May 2022 I was outdoors and I got a TTH. I was so convinced that I got the TTH because I was outdoors that after that every time I have tried to go outside I get scared of the TTH and consequently I get the TTH (=conditioning, which reinforces itself every time I get the TTH), unless I take lorazepam which works well in a preventive way and blocks the development of the TTH. However, I cannot take lorazepams every day so my life is really limited and there are days when I am forced to just be home, mostly lying on the floor. I take 2-3 mg lorazepams preventively at the moment, so that I have some ability to function, since the TTHs just disable me totally. 

Another example is using public transport. I had a bad experience in May 2021 where I got TTH in a bus and after that I have been afraid to use public transport since I fear the TTH. As a result, every time I have tried to use public transport without sedatives I have gotten the TTH and I am even more scared the next time I try it. 

My main problem is that fear of TTH actually generate these TTHs, and the vicious cycle is ready.

Are there any other people with a similar psychosomatic symptoms and have you been able to get rid of the TTHs? I am sure I am not the only one in the world suffering from this specific psychosomatic symptom.",Stressed

605,"Antidepressant withdrawals are making me feel crazy and causing tension in my relationship..  I (F18) recently weaned off of an antidepressant I've been taking for about two years (albeit, way too fast) and have been completely off of them for almost two weeks now. It's my first month of college, I have a major surgery in two weeks, I've been consistently crying most days, freaking out professors and boyfriend (M18), and have been feeling a LOT more critical of myself. I wouldn't tell a doctor I've been having suicidal thoughts, but the thought of just wanting to end everything is popping up a lot more often. I've never been the type to genuinely consider suicide though, I just wallow in that feeling.

It's very frustrating when I can't convey how my crying-spells feel to anyone I care about. I look insane from the outside, but my boyfriend especially doesn't take it seriously when I tell him it's a combination of hormonal factors and withdrawals from my medication. It feels like my self-worth shoots to rock-bottom, my world starts spiraling, and I start NEEDING someone to ground me and tell me how to feel. It's like the crying doesn't stop until I fall asleep or find something large to focus on.

My boyfriend is the type to view my crying as annoying and unnecessary. He says I need to figure out how to deal with my emotions on my own first before he can console me. In some sense, I get it. I do need to find better coping mechanisms and start going to therapy instead of pushing my emotional burdens onto him like I do sometimes. It does not help that my anxious-attachment is very intense right now, because of the emotional stuff. I almost want to yell that it isn't a choice to feel so depressed and cry so much! It does not feel good whatsoever.

Though I can see what he's saying on a logical level, sometimes I feel like he's being cruel and dismissive. My immediate response to problems is to focus on them, cry about them, and solve them when I stop crying. The issue is, I don't stop. My boyfriend tells me to ignore and block out an issue in any way I can. I hope he just means to tell me to level out my emotions before assessing an issue, not to entirely ignore a problem.

I think, right now, I'm terrified that the emotional spiraling is just who I am without medication. Tomorrow I'm scheduling a counseling appointment first thing. I'll keep going unmedicated for a couple more weeks, and if my emotions are still going haywire, I'll start taking a halved dosage again and attempt the weaning process later and much slower.

609,"What‚Äôs the difference between a valid reason versus excuse of being unable to do something because of symptoms such as anxiety chronic pain tension IBS nausea reflux headaches etc  I have IBS, crohns,  chronic pain tension, reflux, anxiety 


Today I was hanging out with a friend and I mentioned how tired and painful I was feeling. She mentioned maybe I should stop using the symptoms as excuse to be unable do something and just push through it. 

Honestly it‚Äôs a bit offensive and kind of just made me think that the real world is not understanding and I don‚Äôt need to tell anyone how I actually feel.  yet maybe she has a point that I need to push through but that sounds like that only applies to able-bodied people 

Is anxiety or worry or symptoms a choice because some people say that our emotions or how we feel as a choice ? 

It could be true sometimes, yet most of the time I  think my reactions/ feeling isn‚Äôt really a choice if I feel bad and I force myself to be positive that‚Äôs not natural at all yet being positive require some effort like affirmations or changing your mindset - so I am confused on this. 

Last year my tutor told me that I should‚Äôve let my teammates know about my chronic health conditions so they can better understand accommodate me yeah I told her I never let people know because I thought they were going to think it was an excuse and I should just suck it up like everyone else

when I push through it sometimes I can achieve it in the end but after a long time and lots of procrastination and it‚Äôs just not efficient at all 

And I realise that actually don‚Äôt let myself properly rest like when I think I‚Äôm taking a break by watching TV and stuff that doesn‚Äôt actually make me feel more rested and when I‚Äôm relaxing I feel guilty and keep on thinking of other productive things I should be doing or how I haven‚Äôt done enough to earn it . 

2. Is it good to rest even though we didn‚Äôt learn it or relax or is that going to feed a cycle of laziness and complacency I just want to know based on people‚Äôs experiences that if they haven‚Äôt been productive and they relax reward themselves without the guilt and shame what‚Äôs the consequence of that do they go on like that forever or they go back to the proper routine and get over it and life goes on?


maybe I procrastinate with mental stimulation like electronics instead of actual rest like sleep or things that actually rest my body and mind because I feel like I‚Äôm not allowed to rest because I haven‚Äôt turned it or did enough work yet yet I‚Äôm in too much pain or tired or anxious and worried to do my work so the only thing left is the kill my time with electronics

The past couple weeks I‚Äôve also been very stressed and been staying up late exhausted 

I I am trying to figure out how to be more productive and manage time better but at the same time being realistic and having self love and compassion

I don‚Äôt know how this looks like and I‚Äôm feeling quite lost I tend to go and extremes because it‚Äôs just much more easier and clear-cut was being in the middle is just so grey confusing subjective that makes me feel unsure if I am doing enough or my best

To me being productive as being able to do the 20 things in my list every day that‚Äôs is a perfect ideal situation and doing my best means that I do all of them and achieve these things 

Yet right now I can‚Äôt do them and my friend mention instead of feeling guilty I should just focus on the top five things and just do that well. 

 the thing is how long do I focus on that ? a few weeks a few months?  I feel like progress might be slow and isn‚Äôt that a bad thing what if it takes too long I know it‚Äôs good not to give myself the pressure because it‚Äôs better for my mental health it could also be an excuse to not improve faster. 

And perhaps end up not achieving as much as I want it like doing more things on my list. 

obviously I would like to feel content just doing a few things because it‚Äôs more relaxing easier . But right now I‚Äôm looking for a job and unemployed and I don‚Äôt know if I should prioritise mental physical health and just relax or I should push myself to do like a 9 to 5 job routine where I‚Äôm productive for every single hour and actually do things like when you‚Äôre in high school where every hour for eight hours a day is learning or doing something

I thought that being productive has to be at least stressful and not relaxing maybe my standards are too high and hard

3. what does too hard mean though ? that‚Äôs also subjective . maybe I‚Äôm a perfectionist expect things to be perfect at the get go no things take time but there also needs to be a limit because how much time is too much time I don‚Äôt have forever to just let myself be at level one

The thing is I get stuff done it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs not systematic like for example I would like to do all these things every day a bit of it but instead I just do one thing a day for a few hours and then the next day I don‚Äôt do it do something else or sometimes for many days I don‚Äôt do anything on my list.

When we have anxiety or stress in our life, one of the ways our body responds is with muscle tension. Progressive muscle relaxation is a method that helps relieve that tension. In progressive muscle relaxation, you tense a group of muscles as you breathe in, and you relax them as you breathe out. I've found it to be very useful...

615,"Tension Headaches / Psychosis / Dissociative  Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm 28 years old and I have been a heavy pot smoker since I was 18. I‚Äôve been depressed a few times (let‚Äôs say 4... all ranging from a week to 2 months) in my life and it always stems from isolating myself in my room, smoking all day and binge eating and binge watching movies, but I‚Äôve always managed to get back out of it and get back to feeling not just normal but really freakin good. I always get myself out of it by exercising, eating very clean, back to work, healthy relationships, yoga and meditation and getting a lot of sunlight. 

This time is very different. Last month i fell into it again (it lasted about 3 weeks). After the 3 weeks i snapped out of it and got back to my normal healthy routine. 2 weeks went by and I seemed to be doing really well. I didn‚Äôt stop smoking but was just smoking a lot less, until 5 days ago happened. I smoked at night and my thoughts were uncontrollable. I thought i was going crazy and I was talking to myself all night long. It went on for about 4 hours and then i finally feel asleep (thank god). This has never happened to me before so I‚Äôm in bed freaking out and just going bat shit crazy. 

I have not touched weed since and I NEVER WILL TOUCH WEED AGAIN. I have no craving for it all. I have no cravings for it bc of how intense and how painful it has been for me these past 5 days. It fluctuates a lot but i have a ton of tension headaches (which idk if this is the right term but sharp pain near my temples) I‚Äôm thinking in my head a lot of the day uncontrollably, and my symptoms seem to match being dissociative/ psychosis. It‚Äôs a bit scary for me to be honest guys. I told my dad and he said go see a psychiatrist. Fuck that. I‚Äôm sorry i don‚Äôt believe in taking anti psychotic meds for my situation or for me i should say. I refuse to believe that i need to take these types of meds bc i put myself into this weed induced state of mind. I‚Äôm not saying everyone shouldn‚Äôt take it I‚Äôm just saying I won‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt believe in them for myself. 

So, yesterday i went to the store and bought $200 worth of supplements and mood enhancers from  Nac to  ashwagandha.  I figured I‚Äôm going to try everything in the world before i going to see a psychiatrist   Since we are all being honest here I‚Äôd rather commit suicide before taking anti depressants or antipsychotics. And i have no judgements to anyone that takes these meds but i just seen what they do to people and i would never (my mom is also a  pharmaceutical rep and sells these drugs so i know a lot about the side effects and about how they switch up drugs like candy and most people feel like non human when they are on them)

I am not suicidal at all i just want to say that but it‚Äôs just been so hard for me these past 5 days guys...Like so tough and I have a couple close friends that I‚Äôve spoken to about this. One said to micro dose shrooms and the other said it will go away in time. I want to tell and talk everyone in my life about this but i feel ill be judged or just told to ‚Äúgo see a psychiatrist‚Äù and i believe that‚Äôs the last option here. 

So i have hope. I think this will go away one day just with being completely sober and goal oriented and doing all the normal things that i tend to do to stay fit and happy.  It‚Äôs just so real right now and I‚Äôm so scared right now.  

I don‚Äôt feel depressed at all. I‚Äôve felt depression in my life and this is just different.  I actually love where i am at in life so that‚Äôs why it scares me.

Desperately looking for help from other professionals or anyone who has gone/is going through anything similar. 

My anxiety triggers terrible muscle spasms throughout my body and vice versa, but my muscles tend to stay knotted up unless I repeat the movement. Almost like the way a snake squeezes tighter the more something fights it, but in my case I‚Äôm trying exercises and tools I‚Äôve learned from physical therapy/psychotherapy only for it to make it worse. The feeling is from within and is as if it‚Äôs pushing up outwards.

It became overwhelming to the point where I‚Äôve hardly been able bathe myself in the shower, have to force my mouth open to eat/brush my teeth, or even wash dishes. Mortifying. I haven‚Äôt been able to hold a regular job for longer than a month or two after all these years. 

I used to think it was just poor mental health but a few doctors/therapists I‚Äôm seeing have said that this may not just be psychological. 

Physical therapy, acupuncture, yoga and chiro did not work. CBD, hot/cold water therapy, and stretching/breathing exercises don‚Äôt work. 

MRIs of my entire spine and head were clear except for very mild DDD in lumbar and nasal polyps/sinus inflammation. But my neurologist said after a year of appointments he does not think it‚Äôs a neurological issue but maybe a neuromuscular disorder/disease. I was tested for Lyme disease and that came back clear.

I‚Äôm currently taking:

Paroxetine 40 mg once at bedtime
Seroquel 200 mg once a day a bedtime 
Buspirone 15mg 3x a day 
Hydroxyzine 50mg 3 times a day or as needed

621,"Quarantine Couple's Tension - A technique to help.  Some couples and loved ones are experiencing a bit of added stress, anxiety, and heightened tension living in such close proximity through this quarantine. It's difficult to manage but here's a little technique which is sure to help put things in perspective for those of us struggling, I call it the Cinderella Effect. Good luck and be well.

.

\-The Cinderella Effect-

Pick a day, one whole day that you will give this scenario a try. The evening before I want you both to pretend that you are going to live your last day on earth, together. You‚Äôll die at midnight the next day... like Cinderella having to leave the ball. I know... I know, it's morbid right? Just hear me out. For the entire day I'd like you to treat yourself, your partner, and your children or other loved ones as if it was your last day on earth.

.

Throughout the day, ask yourself if it's worth being angry over a disagreement? Is it worth being upset? Is it worth being impatient, frustrated, stressed, anxious, resentful, guilty, regretful or annoyed? Is this how you want to spend your last day?

.

Every moment you experience a negative emotion is one last moment and opportunity for you both to experience beautiful ones such as gratitude, compassion, patience, humility, joy, appreciation, empathy, sympathy, grace and love.

.

So each time you feel that negative emotion bubble up‚Ä¶ remind yourself, ‚ÄúThis is the last day I have left to live‚Ä¶ I am not going to allow this negative emotion to steal away any moments from this final and important day,‚Äù take a deep breath and flush out the negative emotion, ‚ÄúI am going to reside in patience... I am going to anchor myself into gratitude and be extremely present for all the gifts and all the beauty that I have in my life... and I am going to celebrate each moment of each day with every breath I take... and I am going to focus my senses; my  sight, hearing, taste, touch, and feeling on experiencing all of the blessings and all of the beauty which surround me in every moment of every day. I am going to clear my mind and remain mindful of presence, of awareness, of my true reality. I am grateful. I am humbled. I am loved. I am love.‚Äù

.

Make an agreement to try this out for one day and observe how much it changes how you treat one another throughout that entire day. Then after I want you to ask yourself something‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHave I been promised more than one day of life on this earth? Am I wasting what could be my very last day on earth being upset? What‚Äôs to prevent me from dying at midnight? Am I wasting time on unimportant bullshit? Could this be the very last day of life I have to live? Could this be the last opportunity I have to live‚Ä¶ to breathe‚Ä¶ to celebrate my gratitude for all of the blessings which have been granted to me and my loved ones? Can I make a permanent change‚Ä¶ can I begin living each day as if it were my last? Can I live one final day filled with love and not fear? Do I have time to make this change? Can I start now?‚Äù",Stressed

627,"I'd like to relieve tension when I talk, but first why do I have it?  Hello redditors,

I am a 26M who tenses up when I converse with people. The symptoms I have become worse when the conversation topic I perceive is deep. Casual talk is ok at times. Small talk I avoid very often, therefore I'm more relaxed. The tension I am talking about looks like rapid heart beating, forearm tension/shakiness, lack of oxygen, and fatigue.

I've been diagnosed with GAD, GDD, and ADHD by medical professionals at the only psychiatric outpatient center I have ever been to. My prescribing PA and therapist are the only ones I've been seen by. They cannot correlate this forearm tension or heart beating to anything except maybe some underlying anxiety. I am prescribed medications for my adhd and gad and even with them I am the same in terms of my speaking habits.

I think about this in 3 different ways:

1. Can it be the GDD? Perhaps. Does it help to be on antidepressants to alleviate physical symptoms? Maybe. I can't really pursue this option fully yet. This is because I don't have insurance at the moment. I'm also thinking about seeing a psychologist in order to get a more accurate read on me.

2. Is it the way I talk? Are there exercises that can help control the way I speak to someone so I'm not constantly fatigued after every conversation? People have made comments on my speaking. It has been perceived as long and tiresome. This option is reasonable to pursue pending on the resources I can find or get from the help of others. I've been proactive at this by looking into general self help books. Except nothing to do with speech therapy yet.

3. Or is this something entirely different? A misdiagnosis? Or a diagnosis not made at all? During my free time, I have thoughts where I think it could be an autistic trait or a mood disorder. There have been instances where in order to release the tension I cry my best or physically throw or punch something. However, these are just theories of mine based on the reflection of my experiences.

Anyway, I'd like to read what others have to say. Maybe you share similar experiences or know someone who has. Any help is appreciated. Looking forward to the responses :)",Stressed

629,"Verge of suicide: Head tension making me feel like my brain is dying.  I have never used Reddit before, but since it has such a good reputation of helping people I thought it would be a good idea to ask for help here... 

Question is:
     I have had this head tension in my forehead all my life and adhd symptoms, with that comes depression and social isolation etc,
What is this head tension that doesn't let me focus?

It's like something, a stick is burried into my head.

I can't think.  I have this flicker or memory that I constantly forget what I'm doing at the current moment and that everything exists.
Depersonalization and derealization.
Slowly I have been forgetting my language, (words and grammar syntax) for about all my school years, now in University, though dropout.
I have social anxiety it seems and my memory flicker is so strong that I feel dizzy. Also maybe general anxiety idk. When asked technical questions or I need to do math for all these years I have been getting slower and slower, mentally speaking. Even with stuff that I love like music, I make music. Many times, I'm composing and I can't focus at all to the music nor can't almost see  at the screen as if what I hear and see is blurry and makes no sense. When doing anything tbh. And I can't see or hear things for so much, a second passes and I forget. It's even hard to sometimes listen to people and read even. Because I forget midway where I am,What's happening what or where I'm reading or doing and I get stuck with me as if zoning out and everything becomes like blurry or something. My head constantly hurts with the head tension, as if I was angry and was showing it with my face.  Before when I was young I was supposedly normal. Had many thoughts and could focus as a normal person with ADHD would or could. But now, I can't even do the simplest of tasks, and it's only been getting worse. And I constantly have these instructive thoughts filling my mind to the brim like. You're just making excuses to not work. 
No this is legit I feel odd, wtf is happening I can't grasp myself.
Maybe you're just dumb.
Maybe, but why can't I grasp reality?
Maybe you're just a stupid child. Or wasn't raised properly.

Anyways not such a good example of the instrusive thoughts. 
Because lately it's been that my mind is just completely empty.
Meditating is even easy, because it's as if I have no thoughts.

I can't even write nor make music like I used to because of this. Had to drop out of college because of this, failed two semesters out of three.

It's really like I can't grasp myself and that my brain is literally rotting or shrinking.


A bit of backstory.

I went to school like any normal kid. I was always alone and had no friends, it wasn't till highschool that I began to create my social skills. 

I always needed help from my mother because I couldn't study, which resulted into a lot of fights I the house and me being alone countless hours everyday trying to learn something but not being able to do so. I still remember the rustle of the trees in my room when Young. I almost had no childhood.

Life was, depressed at school then depressed at home. Always since young constantly depressed.  
I was seen by a neurologist that said I might have adhd. 

It wasn't paid attention and nothing was done about it.
I kept like this. Always getting worse. Then at highschool I think or a bit before, the head tension started, I think maybe at middle school.

My attention to what people were saying started degrading, I was forgetting grammar in my language, both Spanish and English. I was horribly depressed it only worsen. And my head really hurt. Memory got worse and well, everything.

Then forward to recent past.  We went to a psychiatris for diagnosing adhd. In July. It went well I got a perfect score. The Adderall really helped me a lot. I went to university again. And slowly the effects of Adderall started to drop as I always was.
Filled with anxiety in the classrooms and with people.

But this time I started having panic attacks as my anxiety got worse and worse throughout the years. I tried to manage it and do well in University, but I kept getting panic attacks. Believing the I might have a trauma of my school years. Then I tried to kill myself in the dorms twice. Went to a psychiatric hospital twice, which didn't help at all. I also have antidepressants that doesn't do shit.  And the second time I tried to kill myself I went to university again to try more. But I got a I think panic attack so strong. That I couldn't move at all, and I was shaking and my whole body was tense, and dizzy and frozen. It got so strong to the point where I couldn't move nor almost talk. I felt like I was loosing conciousnes.  Then when that happened. I was in my hometown at my house for a whole week trembling not being able to talk properly nor think properly. Having as if mental breakdowns of getting insane. And I had to quit university.  And it still keeps on the head tension and mind dying. Not shaking anymore and can walk. I still have panic attacks yes. But not as intense as that one that made me stop moving.

And now I'm here in the verge of suicide again.  Asking Reddit for help. Wtf is this.",Stressed

Read if you want, only then. 
No coercion, it just creates pressure. 

Technique 1 of 3: against depression, fear, panic, hate, worry, doubt, grief, release tension physically (a little) and mentally (a lot). ""Short-term in case of acute need"" Immediately applicable. Hello, basically it's about the fact that each brain can only carry out a maximum of 4 senses at the same time. For example, thinking is a sense, as is hearing, feeling, seeing, estimating distance, estimating weight, and many more. You can take advantage of this and can be used at any time. ""Only"" the following 4 SENSES must be executed AT THE SAME TIME. Concentration is required! Possibly do technique 3 first to get better concentration. The more practiced you are, the easier it will be!!!
 1st sense: peripheral vision, that is, you look through your eyes without focusing on a point, as if you were looking into the distance, you don't see anything in detail, but you see everything that is in front of you. That goes inside and outside. Panoramic mode, if you will. 
2nd sense: hearing, hear everything there is to hear. Take in every sound. 
3rd sense: feel, feel into yourself, how do your hands, legs, chest, feet feel, everything there is to feel. 
4th sense: focus on your breathing, keep breathing naturally without changing anything. Feel the air go in and out. If you perform these 4th senses at the same time, you will automatically stop thinking (depression/anxiety, panic, anger, hate etc.) 
You can use this very valuable technique anytime, anywhere. You automatically get out of your head and you are in the here and now (present). You can maintain this state and distance yourself from the overwhelming situation. If the nagging thoughts come back apply the technique again, you can remain in this state as long as you like. You will automatically become ""Neutral"" in all respects. You can now decide again whether you want to stay in the present or ponder again (""eggs not laid"" that have not yet happened, worries, grief, etc.) <-> (future and past). If they're doing well or really well, they shouldn't do the technique and just enjoy it.


Technique 2 of 3: How to process recurring nagging thoughts (depression, chronic anxiety, panic attacks, insecurities, worries, etc.) in the long term. ""with system"" 

Step 1 Buy a blank notebook and write down every thought that bothers you. Really all. 

Step 2: If everything is in this book, look carefully! Can you think of what? What do you notice? A tip, probably all thoughts end with a question mark like this 

Step 3: Put the book in a safe place where you can access it at any time. You now have all the nagging thoughts in this book! From day to day your head becomes more and more calm because you have everything in order in the book in front of you and that gives you more serenity. You've probably already heard this effect from musicians who have processed their past into a song. But you will definitely learn more about yourself just because you have it in front of you in a clearer way! (Physically only limited but definitely something. Do you know the feeling when you are really scared and you automatically tense your shoulders, in your face (forehead) e.g., or pull your arms up. This technique definitely does not cause even more tension . )


 Technique 3 of 3: Stop obsessions (anxiety, panic, depression, compulsions, shame or embarrassment, worry, reproach, feeling helpless, etc.) Close your eyes and say: Imagine not a pink elephant. say again and again!!! By saying ""no elephant"" their mind automatically does the opposite. That's why it probably doesn't help if you think or say: think positively!!!!! contrary day.

hp Become aware that there are two voices (trains of thought) in your head. - One side is the mind, which doesn't get any further because there are too many unanswered questions for which you haven't found a solution yet. This distracts you with some trivial things like video games, drinking alcohol (especially beer, Google the medical effects of hops), or you provoke arguments with others, etc. Pondering can then upset your stomach, which can lead to loss of appetite . chain reaction. If the stomach does not receive nutrients, the body does not get the necessary energy to maintain the basic functions of the body due to the ""no starvation mode"". (Temperatures equalizing whether too warm or too cold, thinking etc.) It's a vicious cycle because it makes you shaky and makes you feel even worse. Her mind makes her restless, you drive yourself crazy with the open questions that the mind has. The mind gets stuck because they get stuck. Therefore try technique 2 ""possibly"" times, if you want. Coercion is counterproductive and inefficient. And make yourself aware that if you do Technique 2, you will not only learn something about yourself, but about everyone. We all worry/worry about the same ""shit"". That's why I can understand well how others are doing and can understand trains of thought because I have exactly the same. Only what makes us happy or anxious is totally different (a matter of taste), so please try technique 2. -On the other hand, our subconscious (also called soul, or spirit). Your subconscious, your guilty conscience, is probably always telling the truth. If we act against our conscience, it stresses us directly, like when I destroy 2 bars of nougat chocolate. You know what I mean. Balancing these two sides should actually be a top priority for everyone. (peace of mind) Peace‚ù§Ô∏è

642,"Male 27 possibly mixes anxiety with infatuation  Background: I was in a relationship because I had some form of complexes - I experienced a lot of fear I can't succeed in love. I met a girl (F25) that somehow touched my heart - I wasn't really in love in a sense of this extreme mania about someone - but I felt like meeting with her, spending time etc. She eased my mind to some extent. After about half a year my complex sort of disappeared. In that time I lost the fear of not being loved etc. and meetings with this girl stopped to be so relieving for me - quite obvious, I was very insecure so I had to be around her, when it disappeared, the tension and fear also disperses.

But I have something I would call anxiety and obsessive thoughts about her. I can't stand the fact she is living her life without me around. In my mind there's is a feeling that she needs me (even if she doesn't know xd srsly xd) and I need her. Just having her close would be enough - it would ease the tension, this anxiety and burden on chest and I wouldn't have much of a need to spend time with her. I don't think she is very interesting (for me!) in terms of her way of thinking, her lifestyle, her behavior etc. But I can't move on. It's like in this meme 'reject me so I can move on'. It's so accurate but ffs I've never been in loved with her. I was even in loved with other girl (I know this was real infatuation) and it  didn't solve this anxiety about this girl. I suppose what would help me would be to have a long term contact with her and may be it would cause my brain to get bored or something. But it's more or less impossible - I'm too shy, she is too shy and some other reasons but don't want to make this post longer. 

To relate.it to the background - I hate the fact that it's the same as with this first girl - I need her to get rid of burden on chest, of anxiety, of tension. She doesn't make.me happier. She just makes me fear less. It lasts for years and rely don't fcking know how to.move on. I know it's something for therapy but I just wanted to know if someone experienced or experiences such thing? Maybe something to share?",Stressed

644,"Therapy is coming to an end and I feel so scared that it hurts.  Using a random throw away account just because I feel like  my main is too... associated with me?  So no post history, sorry.

I have borderline personality disorder and anxiety disorders. I have undertaken my first ever therapy which lasts 18 months, with the therapy being mentalisation based therapy (MBT). I have therapy goals and all that and now it's my last 3 months.

With this being my first ever therapy the closer the end date the less capable I start to feel. In the UK, it was a fight for me to get into this type of therapy and to be diagnosed. So the idea of 'what comes next' is so terrifying because I know there are still things I need to address or do.

 No one said this shit would be easy but just till completly I hate myself and while I've learn a lot about relationships and chilling the fuck out I feel like a bunch of other stuff Still remains. I'm not using this is useless just that I'm not... ready.

Note that I have been keeping up with the work and out of 18 months I have only misses 2 sessions and I'm never late. Even with this, my intrusive thoughts and relationship with myself is.. rocky still.

Finding out I'm nerodivernt (dyslexia and dypraixa) was one of the most important things for me as it explains a lot of my childhood issues.  Yet I am still so confused in what I...am? 

I am someone that gets assurance from labels and it allows me to read about and communicate things that may affect me.

If there is one thing that is so hard, it is the overlap in so many conditions and  my unbreakable shell and lack of confidence in everything I do and say.

I try to stay strong for my family but I want to live for myself and not always others. For me personally I find that I wake up and everything moves at 10000 miles an hour and then because of my low confidence I just mask it.ive done it my whole life. Mask that I didn't remember what you just said or get so distracted that I'll go and do something else.

646,"I have COVID-19 And my mental health is going down the drain, made harder by the isolation and how tensions are running high because my entire family has Covid and everyone's angry and upset and very, very stressed.  To start off, I have been in lockdown since March 2020, and because of my extremely paranoid and protective family, I haven't left my house in these past 11 months more than maybe 5 times. As a person who was in college in a different city just a few days before the worldwide pandemic set, and has been stuck at her childhood home since the pandemic started, it's been a massive change. 

Now, I'm an introvert who's extremely close to my family and so the 'stuck at home with just the family and noone else' part didn't really bother me. But this past month, the stuck feeling has really gone up high. It's been difficult and I've really been struggling with my feelings of wanting to keep staying at home and enjoy the time I have with my family and wanting to just, take a break and go away for a while. 

I've got into multiple argument with my parents over this, and all of them ended with me compromise and staying at home. They kept asking me to go the next week, the next day, and I kept saying okay fine I'll go the next time. 

And then my dad got a fever very suddenly and my parents went into self isolation in our house. We were hopeful it wasn't COVID-19, since they're both very careful about everything. And I was told very clearly to not interact with them until they were sure. 

At this point, I hadn't physically met any of my friends since March 2020, and the only person outside my family that I'd met was the grocery store shopkeeper. So the only human interaction I have is with my parents and my aging grandmother, and so when my parents went into isolation, it was very difficult for me. 

Now, I struggled with this particular feeling for a few days because I felt so guilty. *Why was I the one feeling bad?* 

My parents are the ones who are suffering, and I'm just chilling in the house. I should just be hopeful that they don't test positive, instead of being all petty about feeling isolated. It's a normal health thing, get over yourself. 

These were the kind of things that went through my head regularly. 

And yesterday all three of us (except my grandmother thankfully) tested positive for COVID. Since my parents are isolated already, and they were in the same part of the house, the doctor recommended that they continue isolation, and that they keep using the the same room etc. Which, I'm glad because then they can keep an eye on each other. 

I'm currently self quarantined in a different part of the house, alone.  Since the bedrooms are currently used up, and I can't use my old bedroom since I share it with my grandmother, I'm sleeping in the living room part of the house. The couches are too small for my tall ass so I sleep on a makeshift futon on the floor. 
This is fine too. 

But my parents and I keep butting heads on the very rare occasions we do interact. I get that my mom is quite busy and also extremely ill herself, and that my dad doesn't want me to worry about them or get sicker if that's even possible. And that, right now the best thing would be to just listen to whatever they're saying. 

But I can't help but think that it's a little unfair. I'm an adult too. And I have the exact same virus as they do. I can help them out with things they need, so they don't have to push themselves. There is no point in them just trying to push me away both physically, and also emotionally. 

It hurts because they don't really listen to anything I'm trying to say and whatever they do hear, they misunderstood.  

I feel like I'm stuck in a very frustrating place right now and it's very suffocating for me because I'd like nothing more than to talk to them and get ourselves through this virus together. Instead I feel like I'm just on my own at best, and a hindrance to my parents recovery and efforts at worst. The guilt of feeling this way is really messing with me as well.",Stressed
647,"Something to help you...  So for me, two kinds of stretches helped relieve a lot of my mental strain.

1. A combined neck stretch with your chin pointed all the way up with your shoulders pushed back & downwards to help stretch and relieve your chest tension. (You can turn your neck slightly to the right or left for a bigger stretch.)

2. Another is to breath in and hold for 20 seconds with your chest pushed out. Stretching and relieving your chest.

648,"If you've been stressed out by recent events, it may be contributing towards tension in your back, shoulders or an overall restlessness. Its worth taking time to scan and calm your body; its one of the key drivers of your mental health  You might have been feeling stressed recently with events happening across the world or closer to home; a lot of that tension manifests in our bodies without us being fully aware of it. That might be in your back, in your brow or simply in a general feeling of restlessness which could be interfering with your sleep. 

Moving your awareness through the body relieves our stress by grounding us in the present moment. We can be aware and fully appreciate the body's complexity, the details of the tissues, the muscles, the bone, the skin. We can also draw attention to our organs and the functions that they provide - our eyes to see, our brains to think, our legs to walk. Focusing your attention in this way reunites our mind and body, helping us to feel whole again. In addition, caring for your body through awareness, exercise, nutrition etc supports your mental health - inputting positively into the feedback loop between mind and body is one of the important ways we can build our wellbeing.

Never really been the same since, or developed coping mechanisms to help manage it so has been on and off with different medications, but nothing has really helped long term.

Since their first episode, they have been experiencing pain on their forehead, more specifically on one point (central part of the forehead just below the hair line) and you can feel a dent in their head If you touch it. Not sure if this is because the are constantly rubbing it every day.

- Described as if they have a hole in their head
- Rubs this part of their head with their fingers to try and ""break down the tension"" - only way they find it helps but doesn't necessarily get rid of the pain.
- Wakes up, has anxious thoughts and pain then starts
- sometimes stretches out their jaw wide as possible to try and help with the tension too
- Has been like this every day for as long as we can remember 

I really want to help but can't find anything specifically similar to their situation. I see a lot of information about tension headaches, but does the associated pain manifest in a centralised point like the above?

There was a time when the weight of anxiety made every day feel insurmountable. On a friend's suggestion, I reluctantly ventured into a nearby park, not expecting much. Surprisingly, the simple act of walking among trees, feeling the breeze, and listening to the natural sounds became a pivotal moment in my journey. It was as if each step grounded me back to the present, easing the tension I'd been carrying. Now, whenever I feel overwhelmed, I know a brief escape into nature can offer a slice of peace. It's not a cure-all, but it's a reminder that sometimes, a change of scenery can be incredibly therapeutic. I'd encourage anyone feeling boxed in by their thoughts to give it a try, even if it's just a short walk. Nature has this subtle way of whispering that things can get better.

Scheduling an appointment is a massive ordeal that can take me months and I loathe it.

I desperately need an extreme form of treatment where people will do WHATEVER it takes to get me to function. I need to feel guilt and pain around every corner.

Unfortunately, all treatment seems to be extremely mild. I've been on ssris, ssnris, antipsychotics, tricyclics, Nardil, naltrexone, deplin, stimulants, mood stabilizers, esketamine, and dTMS. I am currently going through neurofeedback as well as some supplements due to bloodwork. I'm on iodine, SAM-e + TMG, vitamin d3, and T3 prime. I am also taking a multivitamin. I've had gender dysphoria since I was about 11, so even though I can't feel much right now, I'm still on spiro, estradiol, and progesterone and doing blood checks. I'm never going to socially transition cause I just want to stop a certain kind of stress.

A therapist could work if they are very action-oriented and not afraid to get their hands dirty. I really want to feel pain and make progress in therapy, but the therapists I've had have not been action-oriented. They'll let me chase rabbit holes in conversations. They don't really seem to take charge and try to figure out a way for me to start functioning again. I mean they do try to help, it's just not as action-oriented and as extreme as I need.

* **Find a calming space:** A quiet space, even a few deep breaths in a new spot, can work wonders.
* **Ground Yourself**: Notice 5 things you see, 4 you touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, and 1 you taste. Be present, not panicky.
* **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: Tense and release each muscle group, toes to head. Feel the tension melt with each release.

677,"Living with anxious-avoidant attachment is torture‚Ä¶  I was bullied as a child by my mother and sister so I never got close to my family. Because of this, I never learned how to manage my emotions in relationships but at the same time I crave emotional intimacy. 

I open up to people but then self sabotage or close off because feeling so exposed and vulnerable scares the shit out of me. Once I realize what I have done, I‚Äôve already created problems and tension that ultimately drives my friends and loved ones away. 

Despite being ‚Äúpretty‚Äù, I‚Äôve never been in a relationship because of my attachment style. People that like me back can never get close to me and eventually just give up, and I end up feeling lonely at the end of the day.

679,"Now everybody has depression  It makes me mad that nowadays everybody says they are depressed when it‚Äôs just being sad over something. For me depression is not being able to brush my teeth, get up in the morning or take a shower, texting, having the strength to talk, eat a meal, not getting work done, a lot of intrusive thoughts and even thoughts of self harm. Not being able to do my favorite things and jus feeling empty all the time is the worst. So I hate it when some people claim they have depression just for being sad or things not going their way. I‚Äôm not saying what they are feeling is not true, but people need to stop and think what depression really means before claiming they experience it. Sadly this word has lost its meaning.

Edit: since I didn‚Äôt really explain myself quite well (English is not my main language)
I‚Äôm not saying that people who suffer from depression always show symptoms (those were some examples of mine on a bad episode) it‚Äôs the way some people think depression is more of a mood than a mental health problem. It is very hard because is not visible. 

Maybe this site can explain it better than me ( mostly the second paragraph)

I struggle with conflict/confrontation, I know but I didn't realize how bad it really was.  I visibly shake when there is any negative tension in a social setting and I don't know why.

What's really bothering me though is that this is effecting my relationship.  I'm engaged to 27M and we've been together for like 6ish years.  

I tell him to be open with me about anything that I do that might upset him so we can discuss it, but then I go and bawl my eyes out and plead for reassurance and swear I'll be better even over something small!!!

He's not guilt tripping me or even trying to be malicious just simple open communication, but I get frantic.  I spiral.  I have thoughts like ""I've ruined everything.  I can't fix this.  I'm terrible.  He'll leave me or fall out of love with me and feel trapped."". He in no way causing these thoughts but for some reason I just feel immense guilt and regret.

684,"Disheartening  I've always felt a bit different. Diagnosed with Asperger's and ADHD, and grappling with anxiety, my social interactions can be awkward, lacking the typical ebb and flow others seem to navigate with ease. My mind races, often leading conversations in unexpected directions that can leave people puzzled. My insistence on order might make me seem overbearing, whether I'm reminding my kids to complete chores or interacting with colleagues.

These traits influence how I parent. I often ask my children to handle simple tasks‚Äîfetching a coffee, cleaning up, feeding the pets. While these might seem mundane or demanding, they're rooted in my childhood. Growing up without luxuries, I learned that nothing valuable comes without effort. I aim to give my children the comforts I lacked, but I also want to instill in them the value of hard work, a principle that profoundly shapes my worldview. Unfortunately, this insistence on effort and order sometimes creates tension between us.

At work, my inability to read emotions paints me as an outsider, often branded as rude or odd. This misinterpretation feeds office gossip and isolates me further, sometimes making me wonder if retreating from social settings might be easier.

It's disheartening when efforts to be kind or make a positive impact are met with suspicion, it can feel like the world is turning upside down.

Sometimes, usually when watching television or doing other activities which don't require my direct input, my train of thoughts seemingly gets stuck on a particular detail around me and I feel my brain ""contract"", as if it was a muscle flexing. The feeling is accompanied by a panicking urge to snap out of it as soon as possible, which always happens after less than a second, a bit like when you're falling asleep but try to stay awake.

For example, a few years ago it happened while I was watching a show on television. The host was cutting a metal panel with a machine which used a very thin and powerful jet of water. All of a sudden I got fixated on how unbelievably smooth the cut was, as if the two halves of the panel were two different panels from the very beginning. The weird feeling came and went away a few times and then that was it, everything back to normal.

700,"IMPROVE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH WITH THESE ANXIETY REDUCTION TECHNIQUES  &#x200B;

Tension can be set off by nearly anything, from a passing idea to introduce risk. We all have encountered some degree of tension during our lives, however for certain individuals, persistent uneasiness is a generally crippling condition that they fight every day. Fortunately there are a lot of ways of lessening tension in your regular routine. 

While it is consistently useful to visit an enrolled analyst in Calgary, there are numerous strategies that you can carry out all alone at home. In this blog entry, our group at Prevail Psychology offers a few hints on lessening pressure and nervousness in your daily existence. 

**#1 Observe Your Thought Patterns** 

At the point when you get yourself in that apparently interminable pattern of ""imagine a scenario in which"" questions, hit the respite button. Exactly the same thing goes for any unfortunate considerations about what's to come. Our cerebrums are worked to dissect and shield us from dangers to our prosperity, regardless of whether the dangers are genuine or envisioned. If you end up worrying with regards to an expected future danger, take a stab at noticing your contemplations and continuing on from them without stalling out in the cycle. 

**#2 Recognize Anxiety for What it Is** 

If you have at any point had clinician advising close to you, your therapist might have helped you to remember what tension genuinely is. At its center, tension is a substantial and passionate response to your envisioned adaptation of things to come. When you can perceive that the risk is to a great extent envisioned, you can get down on your nervousness. Acknowledge your sentiments as awkward yet as your body's normal reaction to saw risk. Realizing what nervousness genuinely is, and remembering it like that, will assist your brain with legitimizing and acknowledge, instead of attempting to deny and freezing. 

**#3 Breathe, Breathe, Breathe** 

On the off chance that you have at any point gone to a yoga class or attempted contemplation, you've probably been told to zero in on your relaxing. This training, alluded to as cognizant breathing by therapists in Calgary, depends on you focusing on your breath as it enters and leaves your lungs. Doing this brings down your stomach, quiets your pulse, and improves your blood stream. This method triggers your body's unwinding reaction, quieting down and lightening sensations of stress. 

**#4 Get Moving** 

It is perceived by numerous experts that moving and remaining dynamic attempts to bring down pressure related chemicals and deliveries quieting and disposition helping synthetic substances like dopamine and serotonin. Regardless of whether you lean toward yoga and long strolls or running and weight-lifting, ensure you move your body each day. 

**#5 Be Gentle with Yourself** 

At the point when you are restless, be caring to yourself. This implies getting things done to assist you with feeling better, like going for additional strolls, paying attention to elevating music, or for the most part setting aside effort to put yourself first. This incorporates attempting to deliberately supplant negative considerations with positive and happy ones.

707,"I am finally getting therapy for my anxiety disorders  My therapist lent me her Anxiety & Phobias Workbook. In it, it discusses minor and major symptoms of feeling anxious to full blown panic attacks. It also has TONS of coping strategies.

Its hard though. My anxiety had gone ignored since I was a toddler (I would pick my skin without noticing everywhere I went and it was put off as just a gross habit). I also have had Social Anxiety from about age 10. It was put off as me being shy. To this day I am deathly afraid of my future unless someone makes the decisions for me.

I am posting this to maybe be validated on being overwhelmed after learning to notice a variety of symptoms.

I don't know how to relax and when I try deep breathing and other calming techniques, they don't always work and when they don't work, I get slightly more anxious. I'm not lying when I say that I have several symptoms that NEVER go away.

Such as:

muscle tension, shaky and sweaty hands, shallow breaths, body feeling hot and sweating, and the painful tension headache that might go away for several hours only to return again. I was born with a mitral valve prolapse and arrhythmia and developed asthma at very young.

So If I am anxious all of the time with so many persistent symptoms, how do I relax enough to focus on getting better. I'm even on medications. Could I just be magnesium-deficient? Is this even anxiety or something worse?

I've been (22 male ) wrestling with some mental health issues lately, and I could really use some insight and support from this community. Here's a bit about what I'm going through:

Delusion of Becoming Great: I often find myself caught up in grandiose fantasies of achieving greatness, which sometimes feel out of touch with reality.

Mood Swings: My emotions seem to fluctuate wildly ‚Äì one moment I'm filled with joy and optimism, and the next, I'm overwhelmed with sadness and uncertainty.


Overthinking: I tend to overanalyze every situation, replaying conversations and scenarios in my head until they consume my thoughts, leading to increased anxiety and stress.

Constant Future-Thinking: My mind is constantly racing, obsessing over what the future holds and how I can secure success and validation.

Hyper-Competitive Nature: I have this intense drive to outperform others, which can be exhausting and often leads to unnecessary stress and tension in my relationships.

Dishonesty and Manipulation: I've noticed a pattern of lying and manipulating situations to make myself look better or to avoid confronting uncomfortable truths.Persistent Self-Image: Despite setbacks and failures, I have this persistent belief that I am destined for greatness, which can be both motivating and isolating.

Depression About the Future: While I envision greatness, there's also a looming sense of dread and hopelessness about what lies ahead, which often leaves me feeling paralyzed and overwhelmed.

710,"Can weight loss cause cell damage / damaged neurotransmitters?  I¬¥ve been depressed and overweight my whole teenage years (14-19).

I lost about 110 pounds over the past 2 years and now I¬¥m 21.

711,"My perfectionist hindsight-regret is ruining my life. Literally.  When I have to decide between two options, and these options have in any way a certain emotional factor to them, I get completely overwhelmed, and eventually will, after going back and forth, make an impulsive decision, already seeing that it has certain risks to it.

Best example was two weeks ago when I planned to visit my girlfriend. I could've chosen to reschedule because the weather would turn out to be bad the entire week, so we would be stuck together in a small apartment, posing a higher risk of tension or conflict. But my gf said she wanted to know what it is like under these circumstances and that we're gonna have a chill time anyway.

Well the time wasn't so chill, she was not in her best mood, had a phase of anxiety and was also tense, so I got down into the regret spiral and my mind was everywhere but in the moment with her. I couldn't sleep because I was beating myself up over choosing the wrong week, I would paint vivid pictures of option 2 offering us sunny weather all week long, less confrontation and chilling in the park.

The tension from my side rubbed off on her and after several sleepless nights she was so exhausted that she eventually decided to end the relationship after a short break.

Now I keep looking at the weather forecast for next week, seeing how it's gonna be sunny all week long and having vivid pictures in my head of a great time, without tension, with me being happy and calm about it having made the right decision and therefore no breakup.

This apprehensive and/or hindsight-regret is ruining my life and also relationships. Instead of just sticking with a choice that might not be ideal, but making the best out of it, I'll rather be completely in my head, beating myself up for not evaluating all factors but impulsively deciding.

How do I get out of this? Even now the idea of losing the relationship and spending that great sunny week next by myself feels terrible and makes forgiving myself hard.",Stressed

Basically I'm stuck forever being terminally online with no method of meeting anyone or making friends or going anywhere, etc.

I cannot for the life of me get along with anyone online so online friendships are out of the question, all I can do is browse Twitter all day and end up getting into arguments and it really messes me up, I just get filled with uncontrollable sadness and anger from online arguing all the time and it leaves me with 3 options; Smash posessions, hurt myself, try to hold it in and just make it worse and not get over it for the rest of the day

I'm poor and i keep making myself even more poor by breaking things so I'd like to stop doing that, so my only options for dealing with my life are cutting myself to relieve tension and take my mind off things (since the pain is a good distraction) or just sit with those feelings and let them snowball into a full-on meltdown

713,"Overcoming the emotion-suicide barrier  Hi,

I  am actively suicidal, and similarly to what others find when in this  state is that there is an emotional barrier between you and going  through with it, relating to the impact it would have on other  individuals. I have thought about this barrier quite a bit recently and  have thought of a way to overcome it to an extent.

In  my experience so far, becoming distant from key individuals in your  social circle will cause you to be slowly ostracized and as a result,  slowly removed from the group.  This is great because it overcomes one  of two major areas of the emotion-suicide barrier, being that it will  have a bad effect on your social circle. If they have already pushed you  out, then the effect of ones suicide becomes less severe to them.

The  second major area of the emotion-suicide barrier is the effect on your  family. This is a tougher cookie to crack because connections with  family usually are not as superficial as those with your friends, and so  the usually more genuine bond can remain for longer. I have found that  becoming distant with some family members has the same effect as social  circles where they will stop talking to you and will appear very distant  upon trying to talk to them again. I have also found that in times of  tension between yourself and those you hold a stronger bond with, the  effects are similar. Now it would be a poor idea to cause tension with  those you are close to before committing suicide, as the effect it would  have on them would be compounded instead of minimised.

The  area I am stuck with is that third stage, where your friends and more  distant family members have pushed you away already, but bonds with some  individuals still remain. What would be the ideal way to go about  eroding this bond without causing more emotional distress?

Thanks!",Stressed
714,"Paranoia is making me suffer  My whole life I have been paranoid about nuclear war. When I was 15 or 16 I had to tack towels over my windows and wear headphones because any unexplained light or sound outside would set me into panic. I lost weight because I was too stressed to eat. My only comfort was knowing that there was very little reason for something to escalate at that point in time. 

Fast forward to now. I am 22. The situation has escalated to unimaginable levels due to the war in Ukraine and other diplomatic issues. It seems that the major powers are slipping closer and closer to complete nuclear war, with regulations and treaties being dropped and increasingly aggressive threats being made. I spend every day in horrible debilitating paranoia that it will be my last. I cannot stop myself from obsessively reading the news about new tensions arising. It feels like the end being soon is now inevitable. It is so hard to find the motivation to keep moving forward in my life when it seems like it could so easily all slip away. At the same time, it is so hard to find pleasure or beauty in anything when all that I can think of is it being destroyed. 

At the same time, I feel like a horrible hypocrite worrying myself to death while I am living in a relatively safe (except for nukes) place and others are on the battlefield fighting to death. I understand why everybody wants to keep fighting but this is truly killing me. I would give almost anything just to have reassurance that nobody is going to press the button. I feel shamefully selfish in the sorts of compromises I wish that others would make just to end the fighting and ease tensions. 

I don‚Äôt know what can help me. I know that it is outside of my control. I know that I can make positive differences in the issues within reach. It just can‚Äôt give me the reassurance that I need, and I don‚Äôt think that anybody can. At times, I feel like I‚Äôd rather just die now and get it over with than keep living under this constant agony (disclaimer: I am not currently a threat to my own life or anybody else‚Äôs). 

On the outside, I am perfectly fine. I am physically healthy, I have a well paying and societally productive job from a high skill degree.

722,"Will I ever overcome my anger and hate towards right-wingers? Would it be ethical to even try? (CW: Politics, Violent Language)  This is gonna be a long one, and I know I'm gonna sound unhinged, but just let me speak.

I am a cishet white male American with autism, ADHD, anxiety, and depression. In a nutshell, I was raised a conservative until January 6th, when I realized that everything the right had told me was a lie! I rejected the right ever since. I still feel a bit guilty for ever having been on their side, so I figured I would ""seek to create a world where nobody can make the same mistakes as me.""

I saw the liberals, who I had considered enemies due to right-wing propaganda, and came to the conclusion ""If the Republican party disproves of it, then it is good! If they approve, it's bad!"" Since I had only known conservative approaches to problems, I tried to ""Fight for left-wing causes using right-wing methods,"" seeing the apparent lack of progress the left made on its own. It wasn't so much that the right's methods were inherently wrong, but rather that they were being used for right wing purposes (Ex: It was wrong to kill thousands of people to preserve racial purity, because that's a right-wing cause. But it's okay to kill thousands of people to protect minorities from hate crimes, because that's a left-wing cause). As long as the end goal was ""woke,"" (The right says wokeness is bad, therefore it's good) then the means to achieve it were justified.

Another part of my transition from conservative to liberal was looking at what ""liberals (twitter SJWs)"" do. The idea being ""The right says that these people are bad, therefore they're good."" I basically got the idea that those who are problematic or ""not sufficiently woke"" didn't deserve empathy, and it was okay to use them as your personal punching bags (usually figuratively, but literally would be okay should you meet them in person).

While the transition wasn't the most comfortable, I told myself that it was necessary for being a good person. That if I ever felt bad, it was simply because I was still being influenced by right-wing propaganda, and I needed to go further left. Feel bad for someone cancelled for bigotted statements? Go further left! Feel like I'm not doing enough for the women, POCs, and LGBT+ in my life? Go further left! Feel bad about telling pro-lifers outside abortion clinics to kill themselves? Go further left! Just keep going left and never look back unless it is to scorn those who refused to go left.

I never really had the opportunities to be a proper ally, protesting for the rights of minorities. There are little to no protests in my area, and I often don't have money to donate to causes I care about. I don't have a lot of LGBT+ or POC friends, because I'm not good at making friends in general. The only thing I really had was anger..... anger at the right for hurting people! Anger at myself for being unable to help! Anger at the brainwashed drones who won't listen to me!

In order to make myself feel like a real ally, I told myself that anger/hatred of conservatives was the same thing as being an ally. It made rational sense: What better way to atone for a bigoted past than by making it impossible for anyone to be a bigot ever again? ""No conservatives = no bigotry"" It also started to feel necessary. ""Conservatives will inevitably kill minorities if given enough time,"" ""Conservatives revel in the suffering in minorities."" ""There is no redeeming conservatives! They will always have thoughts of violence and genocide. Look at yourself, you know this to be true!""

Left and right wing became synonymous with good and evil respectively, so far that it now influences my reactions to any news or discourse. If I read an article and doubt it's truthfulness, I check the source to see whether they were left or right (If they're leftists, then it's true. If they're right wingers, then it's false). If someone tells me to do something, I look at their post history for any indication of their political views (If they're leftist, then they're trying to give helpful advice. If they're conservative, they're trying to manipulate me). The most disturbing trend I've noticed in my thoughts is when I'm confronted with news about someone getting raped or murdered, I try to find the political beliefs of the victim to determine if this was a heinous crime or ""just karma."" (I'm sure you can guess which is which).

I think it's gotten to the point where I become quick to suggest some heinous solutions to problems and reasoning ""It's only wrong because the right did it"" or ""It's only \[insert warcrime here\] when the right does it."" Or, in other words, ""There is no left-wing Hitler."" It becomes impossible for me to commit genocide because ""Leftists don't commit genocide. If they commit genocide, then they're not a leftist."" Or ""Leftists don't commit rape. If they commit rape, then they must be a right-winger.""

Whenever the right is brought up, I get visions of the apocalypse or 1984, things that can only be averted by exterminating the right. It's like the mere existence of conservatives inevitably leads to genocide. Like the Holocaust was the inevitable result of Germany having a non-zero amount of right-leaning people at the time. Whenever the news makes me anxious, it sends me into a rage-fueled spiral to ""Save the innocent! Slaughter the guilty!""

""No, I can't! Killing is wrong!""

""Killing *innocent* people is wrong! Republicans are neither innocent nor people!""

""This is genocide!""

""It's pest control!""

""They're just misguided! There has to be another way!""

""They're demons! They don't feel things like empathy or remorse! Do you honestly think they can be better? Get real!""

""Bigots have redeemed themselves! I know it's possible!""

""So your just gonna wait around and hope they come to their senses? They are slaughtering gay/trans people right this very second!""

""I-""

""Are you part of the solution or part of the problem? Silence is violence! Inaction is injustice!

Even when I have tried to open up to the idea of not all conservatives being monsters, everything in the world only seems to be reinforcing that belief Every time a hate crime occurs, it's the right's fault! Every time climate change impacts something, it's the right's fault! Every horrible thing to ever occur in humanity's past, present, and future, is all a result of the right's actions! Every news regarding Trump, every act of corporate greed, every environmental disaster, every manosphere incel, every act of bigotry only serves to remind me of the evils of the right, their complete lack of care for anyone other than themselves, and that they will never, ever change for the better. That believing that there is any good in the right is hopelessly naive at best, and nazi-sympathizing at worst. That the only way to protect humanity from these monsters...... would be to become a monster myself. And there are times I worry I'm already there.

I know it's messed up, and I've been going to a therapist for months about it, but it JUST WON'T STOP! I've tried breathing techniques, I've been given pills, but they merely postpone my next funk. I just want it all to SHUT UP!

TLDR: I was raised to be right wing, woke up after Jan. 6, and tried to forcibly turn myself into a leftist by rejecting everything the right told me, including the idea that conservatives are decent human beings. In order to atone for being on the right, I went as far-left as I possibly could, and taught myself to hate anything and anyone on the right.

Would anyone who was in a similar boat be able to share their experience? or any advice/organisations that might help? if it helps I'm currently living in Norway but I'm originally from the UK.

Edit: for all the people commenting ""you should know that all potential psychiatrists have to complete a year of therapy to become certified"" I am a forensic and social psychologist specialising in conformity and organised crime, its a COMPLETELY separate discipline. I am not nor even was planning to go into anything near counseling as a career but thank you for telling me what I should and should not know. To the rest of you thank you for sharing your insights. I have since spoken to my colleagues and am in the process of getting a referral to a psychiatrist experienced with treating people in my situation.",Stressed

Been to the doctors multiple times, every time my blood oxygen, blood sugar, cardiac health, tension, the works were all great.

Okay so, this is a really huge step for me honestly.

I want to briefly explain what I am feeling right now and it certainly ia difficult to so so. But it is eating me from the inside and I really should talk to someone about this. I mean online.

Ever since I was young, I noticed how I felt some tension inside of me. That tension sometimes made me want to harm others, but back then, I could repress it. But the older I got, the more I started to truly understand what it means, to have this desire. 

What makes me feel very tense these days, is the urge to harm others that is an urge. It is not just a wish or anything. I feel a need to do it, just as any other person is addicted to other things. And why that is concerning, I certainly mustn't explain to you, the reader of this. Especially not, since I have to leave out most closer details to this story at this point.

i'm cureently on meds and that's working great, it has helped me a lot so far, but one thing i seem to be struggling most with is VERY frequent freezes and moments of deep dissociation, as well as nervous overwhelms. 
this stops me from executing my everyday tasks (despite my immense motivation and wish to do them) and while i have communicated this to my current and past therapists, i haven't found something that works yet

so far i've tried many things, from meditating to body scans, somatic movement, moving/walking, touching cold stuff, writing (i have unfortunately developed hypergraphia due to my condition), listening to agressive music/earplugs to 'silence out' the world and my brain, telling myself positive affirmations (they seem to work only for a couple of days and then my brain kinda resets n i gotta find smth new that sticks), and really it's an everyday battle of trying to find something that will work more quickly and longterm. 

currently i've been hyperfixated to find a solution cuz i have a bunch of projects coming up and i'm running out of ideas, and wasting even more time thinking about solutions and looking for them.

She has a really strong sense of right/wrong that doesn‚Äôt always align with the norm. She is stubborn, prickly, and does not communicate well. For example, she would rather assume the worst of an interaction with me rather than tell me she‚Äôs hurt or would rather stay mad rather than apologize. Once, when she was well into her 20s, she told me that I had to get over something because she ‚Äúhad apologized and that meant that it was over.‚Äù I was completely stunned by this. When we were kids, my parents would ‚Äújoke‚Äù (read: dark humor for coping) that my sister would be on a rampage and I would ‚Äúsit in the corner, straightening my halo‚Äù. What this meant was that I was desperate to alleviate the tension and stress in the house.

She was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult. Now, when I approach her to problem solve things using strategies from my therapist, she blames me for not respecting the fact that she‚Äôs neurodivergent. 

So, my question is, do you have a neurodivergent family member who you love dearly but who is a massive ass? How do you deal with it? I‚Äôve looked for a support group for families of people with ADHD and or who are on the spectrum with few results.

So, I found myself in a medical joint known for dealing with folks who'd partied too hard with substances or were wrestling with their inner voices.


This one day felt like a scene straight out of a horror movie. I was just wandering the halls, trying to kill time, when suddenly, this guy starts freaking out.

His voice was so filled with fear, it bounced off the walls and made everyone freeze and just stare. It was as if the air turned heavy, like before a storm hits, and you could feel the tension everywhere.

The nurses, who are usually pretty chill, jumped into action like they were characters in some dark, twisted game, moving towards him with this super serious vibe they had going on. To someone just passing by, it might've looked like they deal with this kind of drama all the time, but there was this vibe that something really bad could happen. You could half-joke that they were taking him to some secret room for a time-out, but nope, they actually took him to this place they call the ""safe room."" It's meant to be a spot where you can just take a breath and chill, but with the heavy mood, it felt more like a quiet corner in a haunted house where you're left alone with your thoughts.

Honestly, it was a reminder of how real and close to the edge things can get in a place like this, and it made the whole ""healing"" vibe of the facility feel a bit more complicated.

My mind is always like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs play outside‚Äù or ‚Äúlets join the team next yr and practice in a club outside of school‚Äù which confuses me. I‚Äôll admit, I don‚Äôt love basketball like I used to yet I still want to play it. I want to keep on going, but idk if its to win for validation or for myself.

763,"Is this anxiety or ptsd  Dizziness started in mid November 2021, went to Canberra on the 10th of December and I had my first near faint experience followed by high heart beat and palpitation. 

Dizziness and lightheaded was followed till the 28th of December when I nearly fainted again and had really high heart rate: went to hospital. They did blood work and ecg couldn‚Äôt find a probable cause. Went to hospital again 3 days later and no findings were evident. Upon my 3rd visit to hospital X-ray was done off my chest and nothing was found. I was bedridden for 6 weeks, everyday was a battle for life, I felt like I was in septic shock everyday. I had to get iv fluids about 10 times because of dehydration, I sweated constantly with no appetite for water or food.

Symptoms 

Lightheaded 
Dizziness
Heart gets tired quickly 
Sometimes my arms and hands become a little numb.
My head feels tension.
heat in my abdomen, back and my ears get hot.
Feels like a pulsating feeling through my body during a bad episode 
Sometimes left shoulder feels warm
My eyes sometimes drop tears randomly
Unable to concentrate at times
Shortness of breath during episode 
There‚Äôs always a tense feeling in my chest and around my heart area. Sometimes hits my lower abdomen and I feel nausea makes my stomach make noises. I have difficulty sleeping my head spins more when I close my eyes. I wake up between 1-3am with a weird feeling as if I‚Äôm scared or something. Vision sometimes becomes blurry. Fatigue and tiredness. Little sudden Noises scare me. Whenever I have a episode that peaks, my hands and feet get sweaty and I feel heat. My hands and feet sometimes get cold. The feeling in my mid left chest area I can‚Äôt explain but it‚Äôs as if my muscles are vibrating. When I stand up it‚Äôs seems my head and chest symptoms get worse for about a minute and then settle down. Same thing happens when I lay down. It gets worse for a minute till it goes back to how it was. Sometimes I can feel it hitting my front part of my head and my sinus feels tense as well. As well as my ears feel the pressure. Lying down seems to reduce some tension in my head. I feel bad 80% of the day really bad 15% of the day and alright 5% of the day.


Let‚Äôs go back to my childhood, my earliest memory is probably when I was around 10. If I would focus on my breathing it felt like I couldn‚Äôt breath anymore. I also had these unexplained spinning and dizziness at a young age during sleep time. Doctors couldn‚Äôt find anything. I was always a scared kid thinking about the worse case scenario that might kill me but in reality it was overthinking. In highschool a few times I nearly fainted out of the blue. Sometimes during sports I‚Äôll hit a point where out of no where my heart would start racing and my breathing would become laboured. Sometimes over excitement caused this as well.

Now medications 

Lexapro 40mg for 6 months, no benefits. Made me really bad during the first 2 weeks and kinda of settled after that, dumbed the depressive symptoms but that‚Äôs about it. Felt much better after coming off, it definitely made my condition worse. Derealisation, fatigue, tiredness, forgetfulness. All of it.

Zoloft 50mg for 18 days and 100mg for 3 days, had a panic attack on day 3 I thought it was Zoloft but found it to be thc later on. Discontinued Zoloft then. No benefits during the 18 days on 50mg and made my condition way worse.

Paxil 20mg for 2 months, probably one of the strongest reactions to any ssri, daily panic attacks losing my mind, as if there‚Äôs a laughter in my head but it‚Äôs my internal monologue creating it but still I was losing it. Pushed on for 2 months and it just made me worse as the days went on.

Agomelatine 20mg no benefits, daily panic attacks, took it for about 36 days.

Pristiq, I‚Äôm on day 54 and I‚Äôve stopped taking it, my last dose was on Wednesday not sure how to stop. It‚Äôs making me worse, mood is swinging, brain fog and all other symptoms are reappearing on this medication.

Clonidine didn‚Äôt do much except relax my body alittle

Lyrica, knocked me out at 25mg and made me tired. No benefits.

Valium 5mg, very small relief, short benefits 3-5 hours, more of a muscle relaxant, addictive in nature.

Clonezapam 1mg, small amount of relief, short relief 3-5 hours. 

Xanax 2mg, haven‚Äôt tried 

Ativan 1mg only have tried 0.5mg and it didn‚Äôt do much.

Seroquel 25mg, good for sleep, couldn‚Äôt sleep for more then 4 hours for the last 5 years or so, now I get a solid 8 hours, it‚Äôs not a 100% good quality sleep but it gets the job done, I don‚Äôt feel tired through the day as before I got sick.

Epilim haven‚Äôt tried chickenend out

Lamictal discontinued on day 3 after developing rash

Lithium 500mg, 37 days. Left like losing my mind not sure if adverse reaction to the lithium or it was some kind of discontinuation I was getting from the lexapro. 

Prozac 4 days to bridge off lexapro 

Thc/cbd oil, made me go full panic mode for 4 hours each time I tried it. Very similar to what I was feeling with the Paxil minus the laughter side effect.

My girlfriends 12 year old daughter has been caught hiding scissors / knives in her room and over the past 2 years has been increasingly adding small (but increasingly not so small) cuts to her body...

She has had mental health / anxiety for about 5ish years now, is getting emotional support from a child psychologist / psychiatrist, has problems learning at school and finds high school REALLY hard.

She tells us that she uses cutting to release the build up of tension from stress from her school and get life 'that never gets better'.

I'm really hoping to get some advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation, or even someone who has struggled with cutting themselves, to help me understand a way out, so that we can guide her in the right direction and offer her the help she needs.

We've hidden all knives and scissors in the house, but this is just a temporary fix, this doesn't get to the root of the problem and solve anything. We know she can get her hands on sharp items if she feels like doing it again.

770,"What Are You? How Do You Know You Aren't Bad?  Hello all,

This is a vent and a call for help if you're comfortable giving it. I hope you're doing well:

Do you know who you are? What you are? What you *aren't*?

I am extraordinarily lost these days. Sometimes I see myself as a good person: smart, thoughtful, compassionate, clever. Other moments I get really scared and self-conscious: Am I actually really a bad person? Am I actually toxic? Do I deserve to feel lonely? Do I lack what it takes to share my life with people? Is it actually impossible for me to feel better? To be human? Should I be defined by my past struggles? By my present struggles?

How do you know you aren't just *wrong*? Could you prove it to yourself? To others? How can you tell that you're a good person? A loveable person? I just feel like I'm missing some innate characteristic everyone else has- something that would make me feel at home with others, instead of tense and broken and 'off' in my own skin.

I feel alien and wrong for feeling so distraught by these things- like the only thing keeping me separate from others is how much I think about this stuff, but I don't know how to stop. I feel ashamed for struggling so much with this stuff- I mean, how do you bond with someone when you spend all your time debating your worthiness? But if I'm *not* worthy, I'd like to be someday, so I gotta work at it somehow.

How do I open up to others, when I'm not convinced I'm even allowed to? How do I do it right, in a world of social critiques and rules of how to talk or not talk and when to talk or when not to talk- what to say or not say or be and not be? I just want to connect with people, but trying so hard seems to disallow me from succeeding. 

This core of anxiety and tension just refuses to go away, and comes out in thoughts like these late at night.

I appreciate your time and thoughts. Thanks, and I'm sorry.

A simple definition for spiritual energy is that blissful wave that can most easily be felt/recognized as present while you get goosebumps from positive situations/stimuli.  


  
Eventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps, feel it over your whole body and increase its duration.  


  
That's when it becomes your spiritual energy.  


  
It really is your spirits energy because of the many supernatural things that you can use it for, which you probably don't know yet. It has been known/documented for thousands of years in the east, is mentioned in the holy books from the three Abrahamic religions and many different cultures over the world have their own ""term"" for it.  


  
Now, you might wonder, what are those traps that stop you from activating this power at the level that is needed to access your spirits abilities?  


  
The list is considerate, from the hypnotic advertisement of detrimental substances, the ""food"" pushed out there, toxic sources of ""energy"" made to look fun consuming, the inumerable amounts of lustful content (that all originate from the plan of keeping you from ever having enough spiritual energy to access the senses from your spirit) and etc.  


  
This energy has been researched and documented under many names like Bioelectricity, Life force, Prana, Chi, Qi, Orgone, Rapture, Tension, Aura, Euphoria, Ecstasy, Mana, Vayus, ASMR, Nen, Intent, Tummo, Odic force, Kriyas, Pitƒ´, Frisson, Ruah, Spiritual Energy, Secret Fire, The Tingles, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Aether, Chills, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.

783,"Health Tips: Eating At The Right Time Has Its Benefit  **Migraine**

A migraine is a powerful headache that often comes with nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light. They can last from four (4) hours to as long as three (3) days or even longer. A migraine can cause severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation.

Warning symptoms which may occur before or with a headache include flashes of light, blind spots, or tingling on one side of the face or in your arm or leg these symptoms are known as aura.  
Common causes of a migraine include hormonal changes in women, stress, sensory stimuli, food addictive, medication and even hunger.

**Tension-type headache (TTH)**

Tension headaches are pains, pressures or tightness around your forehead or the back of your head and upper neck. A tension headache is the most common headache. Symptoms may include dull, aching head pain, the sensation of tightness or pressure across your forehead or on the sides and back of your head and tenderness on your scalp, neck and shoulder muscles.

The Cause of a Tension-type headache is not known but it is most commonly said to be triggered by stress.

**A cluster headache**

Cluster headaches are a series of relatively short but extremely painful headaches which may occur every day for a week or months at a time.

This type of headaches tends to occur at the same time each year and people often mistake them for allergies or business stress.

Cluster headaches, which occur in cyclical patterns or clusters, are one of the most painful types of headache.

This type of a headache is rare and not life-threatening. A cluster headache strikes quickly, usually without warning but common signs include excruciating pain around one eye, but may spread to other areas of your face, head, neck and shoulders, one-sided pain, restlessness, excessive tearing, redness in your eye on the affected side, stuffy or runny nose on the affected side, forehead or facial sweating and pale skin (pallor) or flushing on your face.

3. Music, movies, TV: Either something relatable to what I‚Äôm feeling to reflect on or the complete opposite to de-escalate the tension.
4. Accepting responsibility and making amends: For the times the anger was misdirected at those you care about. I did this today as well, and it eases the burden.

One technique that can be helpful is box breathing. Box breathing, also known as square breathing, is a simple yet powerful technique that can help reduce feelings of anxiety and stress. Here's how to do it (resource from speakhealth.co):  


1. **Find a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down.**
2. **Take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four.**
3. **Hold your breath for a count of four.**
4.  **Exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four.**
5. **Hold your breath for a count of four.**
6. **Repeat the cycle for several minutes.**

  
By focusing on your breath and counting to four, you create a sense of relaxation and control. This technique can help slow down your heart rate, decrease muscle tension, and promote a sense of calmness.  


If you find yourself feeling stressed or anxious, give box breathing a try. It's a simple and effective way to manage these feelings and improve your overall mental health.",Stressed
789,"Extreme envy making me suffer  Hi. I'm 17 years old. As I'm writing this, I am currently fighting off the beginning of a panic attack. My envy is getting to the point where it's debilitating. The subject of my envy can literally be anything, but it usually stems from independent creators (specific, I know) who create things that I aspire to be good at. I'm so tired. I can't get out of bed. I feel as if I can't do anything right. There's not a moment of my life where I have a break from this extreme envy, and it's genuinely taking a toll on me. I force myself to look at whatever I'm envious of, and it makes me feel sick, and therefore worse. The tension headaches I get (like the one I'm experiencing right now) feel awful and heavy. There have been several times where I have had panic attacks and thrown up due to envy. I feel nauseous as I'm writing this. I even cried a bit before hand, and I feel really irritable. I want to be good at things. I want my ideas to be as good as the people I envy and admire. Does anyone suffer from the same problem?

After a psychotic break 2 years ago (lasted like 3 hours, I thought i possibly am the reincarnation of Messias[after quitting weed and multiple sleepless nights]) I feel really unstable and suffer from bad DPDR, blushing,  existentialism and thoughts about living in a simulation, etc.. 

The thing is when I meet other people in University or my friends, I don‚Äôt think anyone notices how weird I feel, some girl even told me I look as if I had ‚ÄûMy life under control and am very structured‚Äú. And that‚Äôs probably not meant sarcastically :) But as soon as I‚Äôm on my own, driving in the bus or lying in bed I overthink.

I just have this ongoing inner tension and fear of.. like everything. Not finding a gf (again), losing my future job to A.I. and becoming homeless‚Ä¶  I even wanted to quit Uni because I thought I was going to fail all my exams but turned out to score 90%.


And that all sucks. Pretty fucking much. This DPDR stuff is the worst. I can‚Äôt even smell the rain or trees.. I have optics and non stop tinnitus.

I hate everything about this mental instability and how I identify with it, but I feel like it became some sort of addiction to ruminate on it, and also In my opinion 70% of all the mental people on Reddit only rant for attention.

I just realised that after all, even with anxiety and DPDR I still am only human. Like most people my age are not special. And I too am not special, like I am not overly great but also not overly bad off. Just plain √ò.

Vitamin D supplements are super cheap and you can even buy them on Amazon. Consider giving it a try. I noticed the change after only 3-4 days already.

But if you take any meds, check in with your doctor or at least Google to ensure it's safe for you to add the vitamin D supplements (there's like three meds that you'd have to be careful with, as far as I know). 

Additionally, if you're vegetarian/vegan or just don't eat a lot of meat, an iron deficiency could also be a reason for your depression. Iron supplements are also on Amazon for little money.

As this is getting a lot of traction: What this post was about is that my therapist as well as I thought that I had depression. But taking vitamin D solved many problems for me. A vitamin D deficiency can cause many of the symptoms depression does, up to the point of a misdiagnosis. That's why this post exists. Some people may be misdiagnosed, some people may not even have a therapist to diagnose them so they did it themselves and rolled with it. 

This post is a suggestion to consider the possibility and try something new, to raise awareness that something that looks and feels like depression doesn't have to be exactly that.

832,"Depression?   Hey guys, thought I'd post here bc I've been baffled with what I'm dealing with and am unable to afford therapy( I do take antidepressants though for 7ish years now) 

I'm kind of baffled with what's going on with me. I'm horrible at explaining things so plz bear w me. I'll try and keep it short n simple. 

I'm having a hard time doing the bare minimum in my life, every task seems so daunting and overwhelming. And I constantly end up behind on normal basic tasks that everyone around me can keep up with such as laundry, keeping a clean room or paying bills etc 

I struggle so hard to keep up and I end up stressing out alot. It seems that my life is always rocky and I feel as though nothing goes my way. I see things in black and white alot and see things strictly as either being "" good "" or ""bad"" and no inbetween. I wish I was able to see things differently and maybe more realistically like others around me seem to do. 

I feel as though I'm unstable most times,  Like I'm not in control. And I get stuck on things and overanalyse them to an unhealthy amount- i tend to do this with my relationship where I feel as though my partner doesn't love me or moreso thinks negatively of me even though he is so re-assuring and it's the healthiest relationship I've ever been- I'm incredibly lucky. It makes no sense. My brain is so illogical and I'm aware of that but I get so caught up in my own thoughts. 

For example if I walk outside, and cars are driving by I'm thinking about what each person in the car that goes by is thinking of me and majority of the time I will be habitually thinking of all the bad negative things they are thinking of me ( projecting maybe?) My own insecurities onto everyone I meet around me. 

I'm tired. Wanna be healthy. Wanna do better. Therapy would probably be great for me but isn't an option. 

Basically I just want to know if anyone else can resonate with me here, if they know what symptoms I'm experiencing or if you have any helpful advice. Just feel abit lost and unable to tell people in my life what I'm dealing with. 

For a little background I've got nothing to do with my father, I moved states away from my whole family bc it was a deadend area with no opportunities for me and I was previously living with my mother whom I was extremely close with but wanted to leave due to her abusive partner. I've experienced abit of shit but I wouldn't call it trauma personally although it probably is. I am always confused as to why I'm struggling to just keep up with life and live in the moment and feel good. I am unable to hold conversation with almost everyone I meet and feel disconnected.

I think I used them as a coping mechanism and well this is how I always felt or how I felt for a long time. I just realized that, I just realized that I have no hope for myself and think that i am beyond help. Now i am kinda connecting these feelings with depression because i know that they are common symptoms so i am interested what are the chances that i might be depressed? Its true that no matter what or how i try i still feel that i have this fundamental flaw that can not be fixed.I dont have  low mood though, i still go out and have fun with friends. Athought it feels like i cant connect with people on a deep level because i feel constant emptiness and think that nothing matters, idk i feel like i genuinely have fun with them sometimes and from what i have heard i dont think  this is depression.

My names Jack, I'm 15 years old, bi (not come out to anyone), have dandruff, acne, pretty fucking ugly all things considered... And severe anxiety and depression.

I was living great until last June. At the time I had 2 best mates, who I'll refer to as M (funny, kind but not entirely good to talk about mental health and touchy feelings) and K (kindest person ever, used to be able to speak about anything to, but mentally isn't great). K had severe mental health issues and was not listening to anybodys advice about seeking help. Eventually I asked M if I should confront her about it, he agreed, I did it because my other friend who I'll refer to as J (narsasistic, arrogant, but has a soft side occasionally) had been telling me for months she was an attention seeker. I figured she'd take it alright but I was wrong. She trusted me more than anyone (her words) and it was the worst thing anyone had apparently told her.

It bothered me alot and I kept trying to make ammends because I felt TERRIBLE.

I was relatively stable in the grand scheme tho.

2 months pass and August aka summer holidays hits! Worst month and a half ever. J had somehow convinced M I was basically a backstabbing, lying piece of shit and essentially the worst person ever.

We argued back and forth for a while. We fell out hard to say the least.

It broke my heart losing both M and K (I guess J) in such a short time and the misery started to sink in.

HOPE WASN'T LOST. I had 2 friends left B (kind, nice to talk with, quiet) and Z (think J but a geek gamer and a textbook bully) I had a plan to get M K and J face to face (all previous stuff was done by text). Z was on holiday. So I tried asking B to get them together, he said to wait until school but I insisted as K didn't go to our school. I accepted tho. However (according to what I've been told) B lied I think and told Z I had manipulated him into trying to get them all together. Z bullied the shit out of me.

This is where I think my depression sunk in, I couldn't think properly, lashed out in anger out everyone, was bored of gaming, etc. Moral of the story, I wanted to put a bullet in my head!

September hit and school started (year 10). Depressed anxious and suicidal my studies went down and thus my grades.

Then my parents split, IT SUCKED. My father isn't exactly great, he can be abusiveish at times.

Everything started to get worse and I ran away several times, and dragged a knife across my arm alot.

I started to sit in the library for most of the day and still did until corona. Got sent work and it definitely helped with my anxiety as I was bullied and a laughing stock in year 9. Pretty badly. So being out of lessons was alright.

I started seeing the school councillor which helped to have someone to talk to. 

In December the school had no choice but to take me to arrow park hospital as I had massive scars across my chest from self harm. I stayed overnight and my parents ended up kinda talking things out.

I had to go to therapy to say the least. I was still on the edge of suicide.

Started the 8 week course this January and it was alright. Helped keep me positive. 
J and Z made me want to die more as they constantly reminded me of what I am, a monster. Told me I was worthless, should just do it and brought up my Instagram stories (I used to post on them suicidal stuff as a cry for help but was just accused of attention seeking). Worse too. 

Throughout the next 2 months I still stayed mostly the same. Suicidal, depressed, anxious, most importantly lonely. Me and M eventually worked things out because I actually put the effort in a lot over several months begging him and K to help me and how sorry I was. They didn't really want to be my friend. K and I are currently on OK terms I think, imma take it slow with her. M and I talk a lot now.

But... I still feel lonely, have to hide how I feel now. Don't really have anyone to talk about this stuff to. Anymore at least. I still hate my life. Want to die. Does make me wonder if I'm actually really liked by anyone.

But how would I describe myself? Gamer (mk11, overwatch, paladins and smash), want to do well but knows I can't, socially awkward on 1 to 1s, try to be funny, nice to people who I care for and are nice to me, would die for my closest friends. But I'm lonely ultimately, depressed, can't ride a bike, swim, fear of driving etc.

Till last year I would ignore any thoughts of it happening and I didn‚Äôt even cry at his funeral or after because I knew how much pain I would have to confront. But last year , moving out of town and living alone , my grief confronted me. I would never leave my room, I never ate , showered or spoke to my roommates for most days I was a ghost. My alcohol abuse was bad and I would smoke at least 2 joints a day. I dropped out of law school thinking it was too focus on my business career but I‚Äôve realised now that my dad was my true motivation to get a degree.

For me depression is not being able to brush my teeth, get up in the morning or take a shower, texting, having the strength to talk, eat a meal, not getting work done, a lot of intrusive thoughts and even thoughts of self harm. Not being able to do my favorite things and jus feeling empty all the time is the worst. So I hate it when some people claim they have depression just for being sad or things not going their way.

I think I've noticed a pattern of psychosis sprinkled throughout my life; starting way before I ever touched alcohol and drugs.

It's way more noticeable now because I've been so focused on learning about my problems and being mindful. I find myself being delusional at times and I can hear my logic screaming that things aren't correct, but everything feels right.

It isn't until days or weeks after the fact that I notice that I've been stuck in an ignorant, suspicious pattern of thinking and full of anger/negativity. In hindsight it seems almost as if parts of my knowledge has been blocked off from access and my conclusions are incorrect because of it.  I had always attributed it to my terrible anxiety overthinking me into a corner.

The state of ""psychosis"" seems to follow instances of extreme stress overload.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? Have you been diagnosed? What kind of working concepts/analogies have you built to understand what's going on? How does therapy approach this issue?

I plan on going to both a psychologist and a psychiatrist for all the mental stuff I deal with. I prefer therapy over medication, but I wanna cover all my bases.

Classes that are dependent on attendance, essays, or assignments that take weeks to complete I always fail, drop, and give up. I'm tired of this pattern and I so want to be successful so badly. I don't have the energy for hobbies, consistent routine, reaching out to people (by myself), or long-term projects. Please I want some advice on what to do.

I have no issues with violence nor hallucinations, just a general lack of motivation to do literally anything due to the lack of a meaningful emotional connection that I've been denied endlessly throughout my life and will probably continue to be denied.

It's common for a lot of people suffering with depression to feel that life is pointless and a waste of time.

This train of thought always leads me to the same answer; which is that my depression isn't caused by some sort of chemical imbalance, or poor circumstances, but the understanding that my life is in fact pointless.

For the past three-ish months that I (21F) have been going to the gym, I have been overwhelmed with a feeling I can best describe as existential dread and hopelessness. It's to the point where it pretty much ruins the rest of my day and I'm tired of feeling this way. The only thing I feel like doing after I go to the gym is stare into space and feel like sh*t. I am at a loss and I don't know what to do.

I feel like I should feel better after going to the gym. I feel good during most of the workout and sometimes I'm even excited to go to the gym, but about 3/4 through my workout, the feeling sets in. During this, it feels like nothing I do matters, I have no motivation to do anything, I can't fathom waking up and going to work/doing school the next day. In general, I feel like a hollow shell with no purpose. 
It's also worth mentioning that I don't feel this way really any other time except for after the gym. If I skip the gym, I feel fine. Please help.

For some background gym-wise:
 I've been strength training/powerlifting for the past 3 months regularly. I've trained this way in the past for a couple years but fell out of it after my gym partner moved 1.5 hours away. After that, I trained off and on for like 2 years and started going regularly again somewhat recently. I didn't have this issue until recently and I haven't done anything different. I've also been dieting to try and lose weight (down ~7lbs currently). My calories are low, but my metabolism is downright terrible and I have to be in a significant deficit to see any progress at all. But I haven't been particularly restrictive or anything eiither; this has actually been the most successful /least mentally-damaging weight loss attempt I've had.

Some background on the mental health front: 
I've struggled with depression/suicidal tendencies in the past, but this is different and it doesn't feel the same at all. I kicked my depression for good about 7 years ago and haven't had any significant depressive episodes since. More currently, I've learned that I struggle with OCD, but I manage this well, all things considered. With some exposure therapy and whatnot, I am generally on top of my obsessions/compulsions, unless I've been particularly stressed, but I recover somewhat quickly once the stress has passed. Again, nothing like this in the past.

I have been on anti depressants many times on and off through out my life. I have not been on them in maybe 2 years now. 

In October of 2023, I suddenly started feeling very out of it and unable to socialize or pay attention on social situations. Like I would dissociate and not be able to come back in. 
I stopped sleeping for MONTHS it was awful. I was medicated for it and I believed the medication was causing me to feel depressed. I had lost interest in pretty much everything. I think the term is anhedonia. 

I‚Äôm off the sleeping pills now but I still have the anhedonia. 
The reason I ask if this could be depression is because I don‚Äôt feel sad like I did in the past. I just feel numb. 

I completely lost my sex drive, have no interest in dating or intimacy (and I miss that). Have no interest in friends of making any. It feels like a chore to do anything other than be at home watching TV. I‚Äôve gained weight out of nowhere.

912,"Childhood depression questions  I recently found out I was diagnosed with depression as a child. I have a narcissistic father that constantly was at war with my mom. Leaving all responsibility to her and victimizing himself financially. They fought a lot and life blurred at the time, I hardly remember anything from 6-12 years old. I constantly felt unreal and the world was cloudy and faded. There was a time where I just remember being anxious every day and freaked out for no reason. We moved every few years, my mom and dad would get back together some of those moves and it always ended terribly. Moving on to now my dads back in my life, hes better than he was but he‚Äôs still narcissistic and be littles people as much as he can. He leaves all responsibilities to his kids and disrespects my mom whenever he gets the chance. Like I said though, as he‚Äôs aged he oddly has days where he‚Äôs a caring father and it often surprises me. But, as I‚Äôve aged I‚Äôve started having old feelings of deep dread and anxiousness arise. Until I turned 17 I weighed 110 at 6‚Äô0 and I always thought I was just getting odd puberty swings, I fought through zero appetite and constant puking and abdominal pain to the 164 pounds I weigh today. I still often have zero appetite and don‚Äôt feel like eating but I power through it. There‚Äôs days where I feel amazing and days where I feel like absolute garbage, sometimes weeks. There‚Äôs also days where I wake up angry and frustrated, if anyone asks me a question I feel like blowing up on them, but it usually dissipates as the day goes on. I‚Äôve been using methods like working out, meditating and taking supplements to better my self and deal with these feelings.  I ignored these feelings until I turned 20, I realized feeling this way definitely isn‚Äôt normal and somethings gotta be up with me. I asked my mom about it and she explained to me that I had been diagnosed with depression around 6 years old, my dad had left my mom at this point so I couldn‚Äôt afford therapy as often as my mom would‚Äôve liked. I don‚Äôt even remember a second of the therapy, like my brain just erased it entirely. Is there a chance my depression carried over into adulthood? ",Stressed

That is one of the things which is draining my self confidence and so when i go talk with the girls, they behind my back they would mostly comment on the way i speak and out-of-nowhere they would make fun out of that.

I‚Äôm 21 atm and for about 3 months now i‚Äôve felt really good mentally, things that would‚Äôve definitely set me back in the past have just flown right past me and have had little to no effect on me. The first month i was very focused on trying to savour the fact that i was feeling good. It‚Äôs something i‚Äôve always done, it‚Äôs what i‚Äôve learned to do as those moments were sparse. After the first month i was very worried that i was gonna fall back into a depression harder than i‚Äôve ever done before, because i never dared to climb this far out of my depression hole. It was a month of a lot focus on self reflection and self care. It did affect my grades for school but it was different than how my self focus affected my grades before. Now i‚Äôve reached the end of month 3 and i feel like im standing so far away from that hole. I think for a long time i didn‚Äôt want to get out of my hole because it felt familiar and weirdly comforting and save. It feels so freeing but so scary at the same time now that i‚Äôve allowed myself to feel good, and to be honest, feel in general. It‚Äôs just weird, the fact that i feel good but scared about it. I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do next, i‚Äôve never for the life of me thought i‚Äôd get this far, do i just live like a mentally stable person now? Wil i ever see that hole again?

925,"So frustrated with depression  I feel like depression is controlling my life. I started seeing a new doctor a year ago and she first started me on 20 mg zoloft for depression, 50 mg seroquel for sleep and 20mg straterra for ADHD. The only drug that I felt has made a significant change in my life is seroquel. Finally, I'm able to fall asleep and stay asleep. 

We did a genetic test that showed zoloft was not compatible with my gene makeup. So a couple weeks ago I switched to 20mg Geodon daily. I noticed the depression getting worse, so she bumped my dosage to 20mg Geodone twice daily. As I'm writing this, I feel like I can't get out of bed, can't read a sentence from a book, typing this out is a chore. She said to do 40mg daily for the next two weeks, then come see her and more than likely double to 80mg daily. 

I'm just so frustrated with this experience. What's most frustrating is not knowing what drug is fulfilling which function. I don't know if Geodon is the answer.. how could 40mg a day not be making the same impact the 20mg zoloft was making? at least with zoloft I could get out of the bed in the morning, sing in the shower, feel generally ok about life. 

I'm going to contact my doctor on Monday when she's back in the office, so I'm just ranting here. I don't know if the Geodon is helping with depression, or if it's even used for depression. 

I'm in counseling as well and have been making tons of progress with therapy. I just can't take this depressed feeling anymore. It's changed who I am by myself and with others. I can't even fake being happy at this point. It's just a constant wave of sadness and feeling down. ",Stressed

Been battling with depression since was 16. It's been a real rollercoaster, you know? Some days, I'm like, ""Let's end this""' but then chicken out. Weird, right? Can't even tell if it's just how I'm wired or if life's just been hitting me hard from the get-go. But one thing's for sure, I've always had this itch to vanish completely, like off to some deserted island or hiding out in the woods like Walter White. And l'm not picky about how it ends, quick or slow, 'cause deep down, I feel like deserve it. Living feels like a never-ending struggle, yet don't feel like deserve to keep going. I'm so numb these days that I catch myself finding dark humour in my suicidal thoughts. It's messed up, I know, but it's been so long that it's just a part of who am now, shaping every bit of me.

I've gotten so used to these thoughts that they're like my default setting. It's like they've become part of my identity, you know? And the thought of not feeling this way scares the hell out of me 'cause it's like, what else have got? No friends, no social life, just me holed up at home for weeks on end. That's been my life for ages now, and I've kinda made peace with it. It's like I'm scared to lose this messed-up part of me that defines who am. Everything I've done has been with this wanna check out"" and ""l'm all alone"" mindset. And hitting 23 soon? That's a wake-up call in itself as I've always had this thought in the back of my head from young that I wouldn't make it passed 24. 

Usually, l'd be bawling my eyes out thinking like this. But now? Nah, I'm just blank, empty. I'm craving some sort of release, feeling like l'm at the end of my rope. I feel pathetic, like I'm just stumbling through life with no clue where I'm headed.

I barely feel like a person anymore. It's been a downward spiral, and can't bring myself to open up about it to anyone. My family's in the dark about it all, and even my girlfriend, bless her heart, only knows bits and pieces 'cause it's tough to deal with these things when you're long distance and honestly recently I feel like I'm just a burden on her and she deserves better. And honestly, I reckon l'd just drain her energy if I let it all out. I doubt anyone gets how deep these thoughts run. Opening up to my parents? That's a can of worms I'm not ready to crack open. And don't even get me started on seeking professional help. That'd slam shut doors l'd never get open again. Graduated uni, but job hunting's been a bust. I thought it'd be my ticket out, a fresh start, but no dice.

Sleep's been a joke lately, barely scraping a few hours a night. Always tired, always on the edge of losing it. Ijust want some relief, man. Physically, entally, emotionally, spiritually-I'm just yearning for a way out. I used to be all fit and and cheerful surrounded by mates. Now?

I got platonically close to a colleague who was probably the worst for my mental health. He was negative, gossips a lot, and very insecure. After I spoke to my stepdad about some things I noticed this person wasn‚Äôt helpful. To quote my stepdad ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt align yourself to losers at work.

I live alone and last month I had an abortion. This made me get closer to my sister and mother for emotional support. I had been distant with them in the past because they both have NPD (mother) and BPD (sister).

I‚Äôm still grieving the loss of my baby. I was getting better then suddenly sank back down the hole.

I feel since last week (said events with sister and mother) my mental health is on a downward spirale. I had a lot of life changes last year, and again, same time this year, they were extremely abusive and berating.

I've been having mental health struggles ever since I can remember. Mostly with depression and anxiety. Have gotten therapy ever since I was 12. I have seen seven psychologists since then. And since my 19th three psychiatrists. There have been ups and downs. But never completely symptom free. It has been quite bad again since may of 2022, me and the specialists have never been able to lock down the triggers. 

In the last year alone I have tried 6 new anti depressants and I got on lithium. The anti depressants never have helped me. My current psychologist has basically told me she does not have any treatments left. And last week my psychiatrist told me she doesn't know what she can or should prescribe me next.

I am a 4th year university student and I recently began an 8 month internship. Since I started 2 months ago, it has been off and on depression. I mainly feel super depressed from around 9am till 3pm ish and then happy in the evening for some reason. When I am in a depressed mood I feel like I hate working, want to quit and wonder the meaning of it all. But when I am in a good mood I enjoy my mundane job and want to seek out more work. I have had a history of anxiety and depression since high school but I have had it under control for a few years, to the point where it was very mild. I have been taking an antidepressant at a fairly low dose for around 5-6 years now. I believe that I have a very good life and no reason to feel this way, I should be happy and grateful for the position I am in. I have a wonderful loving family that I can tell anything, a great girlfriend of 4 years, lots of friends, no financial struggles, and now I have a great internship at a great company. 

A few reasons I think this may be occurring:

- I quit nicotine about 3 months ago
- Recently discovered I might have sleep apnea
- Maybe a deficiency in some sort of vitamin 
- A scared feeling towards becoming an adult 
- Existential crisis maybe
- Seasonal Depression perhaps (Winter in Canada)

What would y‚Äôall recommend?

944,"OCs made out of depression  So... uh, hi, this is the first time talking here! This is the first time i actually make a post here so it feels a bit awkward, anyway, im not sure if i should tag this venting or thoughts/opinion, but i've found a strange way of conveying my emotions and i feel kinda ashamed/feel stupid because of it, but not to the point where i want to stop.

Throught my entire life, one of my favorite hobbies was making OCs, at first it was some dumb stupid child thing like making comics or something else, but recently i've kinda been hit by a wave of depression and, although most of the people i have met tell me im a very expressive person (which is a trait im not particularly proud off) and very easy to read, i feel the exact opposite of that, feels like nobody understands me or even cares enough to try to, and i cant even understand my own emotions most of the time, so for a good while i was desperate, i had tried everything up to that point, but nothing seemed to work, hell i even tried making my own digital diary using the little knowledge i had of python, and nothing seemed to... i dont know how to say this, but like, nothing felt right.

And then one day at a therapist appointment, while i was having trouble talking about what my ""cruel inner voice"" told me, my therapist suggested that i gave that voice a name, i just came up with a random name on the spot, ""Edgar"", idk why tho, i never even met someone with this name, and my therapist was right, it was easier to talk about my anxiety after giving it a name, but it was still hard nonetheless, after a week though, out of sheer boredom, i decided to make an OC based on this, idk why but it sounded cool at the time, ""Edgar"", a literal incarnation of depression, i based his design on the famous ""man in the corner"" that oftenly appeared in my nightmares, so he ended up being a tall lanky shadowy man with a tophat because tophats are usually a way to show power and my anxiety practically rules over me most of the time.

A while later, i felt way more comfortable talking about my insecurities and intrusive toughts by using Edgar as a puppet, like instead of saying that i have some kind of inner voice telling me im ugly i can just say Edgar tells me im ugly, i talked about him and used him to vent to a few close friends, most of which seemed pretty weirded out by this, except for one which was supportive of me at first, but we ended up growing distant with each other so... fuck that, and i wasnt really bothered by my friends being weirded out by me at first.

I even created a few others to represent feelings or parts of me i dont like (for example, i made one to represent my anger and called him ""WARTH"", a pun between war and wrath), the most impactful one i literally ended up calling ""PARANOIA"", a short dude whose skin was literally made out of intrusive toughts (i would just draw his outlines and eyes and then write my 'bad toughts' all over him as a way to vent and get them out of my head), and they really help! Whenever i finish making/drawing them i feel a bit relieved and better.

But over time i started feeling insecure over these characters, i dont even know why though, i used to love them so much and, while i still love them and they still help me get my toughts out, now i usually feel guilty or stupid after drawing any of them, almost as if even i started feeling weirded out about myself, whenever i finish drawing them (or dont, sometimes i just stop midway through) i just get frustrated and rip them off my drawing notebook and either toss them out or hide them somewhere in my room, god i feel so stupid because of this but i have grown attached to these characters, is it bad that i do this? Should i feel guilty of this? I mean they do help at getting thoughts out of my head but, i dont know, i feel stupid doing this, like a pathetic child that can only take medication if its in the middle of candy.",Stressed
945,"Depression because of hair  I need help how can i describe my situation to a therapist. I am planning to have a consultation next month but I am having difficulty how can i put into words what exactly is going on with me but mostly I feel very very sad.

I have been actively stalking a girl for 5 years. She was a complete stranger I saw in the elevator at my previous job years ago. I remember what struck to me the most was the color of her hair. 

Anyway, I organized a plan how I could know her without her knowing or acknowledging me completely. First thing I did was to know her name which I managed to obtain through the previous job's log book at the reception area. I looked up her name online and stalked her through Facebook. Let's call her J. The stalking was mostly done online. I stalked every person I see on her Facebook account and I thought to myself I should befriend these people around her. With that being said,  I dated one of her previous classmate and one previous co-worker.  I made sure that these people that I chose can provide me just enough information about ""J"" without being suspicious. I would break up with them after I get what I need. 

As time goes by, the stalking gets more serious, I started visiting her workplace. She worked as a waitress in a restaurant. I go there, dine in couple of times but not too many times for her to recognize me. Another risky move I took was last November when i managed to find out where ""J"" would celebrate her birthday. ""J"" did not post anything about this party but I flirted with her cousin (online) couple times and was able to convince the cousin where they would held the party. ""J"" was born on Halloween so she threw a costume party. She has never done this before. I took it as perfect opportunity. I dressed up as ghost face, went there, blended in the crowd and just watched her from afar - eavesdropping with people around. I learned there that she is in a relationship. Okay, no big deal. I am not romantically attracted to ""J"" but still, I went home, stalked her account. No indication that she is in a relationship. So i think, maybe it is a private relationship but still I am thinking, why she need to hide it. Maybe there's something to hide. I dig deep. Stalked her new followers, stalked her old followers, checked everything and finally found out it was her boss. I was disappointed with ""J"" for having a relationship with a man 20 years older than her but again I cannot do anything about her choice in men. But no matter how I deny it, I am feeling furious inside - just a little i think. Fast forward this year something happened that confused me. ""J"" dyed her hair and the moment I saw it, I feel my stomach turn and its like I do not know her anymore. First, she made relationship to a much older guy and then now she changed her appearance. I stopped checking on her but i am feeling really really sad I even cry in public places. Nothing makes me happy and I feel so low. I tried to stalk another girl with the same hair color but i do not feel the same joy. I want to stop feeling sad but i do not know why. I hope I can have an organized thought telling all these to a professional.

947,"Ways to Overcome Depression?  Life can be a rollercoaster of emotions, and sometimes the lows hit harder than we'd like. If you're struggling with the blues, you're not alone. Let's talk about some simple and practical ways to kick depression to the curb.  
  
Connect with the Sunshine  
One of the simplest mood boosters is soaking up some vitamin D. Step out, feel the sun on your face, and let those rays work their magic. Whether it's a short stroll or an outdoor coffee break, nature's antidepressant is always ready to lend a hand.  
  
Exercise- The Happy Pill You Don‚Äôt Need a Prescription For  
There is no need for a gym membership or fancy equipment; just get moving! Whether it's dancing to your favorite tunes, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or trying out a new sport, exercise releases those feel-good endorphins that are like a natural energy booster.  
  
Curate Your Playlist of Positivity  
Music has a magical way of influencing our moods. Create a playlist filled with tunes that lift your spirits. Whether it's a power anthem or a soothing melody, let the beats guide you towards a better headspace.  
  
Unplug and Recharge  
In a world where screens rule, it is imperative to take a vacation. Step away from social media, put down the phone, and indulge in activities that nourish your soul. A good book, a hobby, or even a nap can work wonders.  
  
Gratitude‚ÄîIt's Trendy for a Reason  
Take a moment each day to reflect on the positive aspects of your life. Gratitude can shift your focus from what's lacking to what's present. Keep a journal, jot down a few things you're thankful for, and watch your perspective transform.  
  
Conclusion  
Remember, overcoming depression is a journey, not a sprint. These simple tips can be the stepping stones to brighter days, but if you're struggling, don't hesitate to seek professional help. Reach out to friends, family, or a mental health professional‚Äîyou're worth it! Let's support each other on this rollercoaster ride called life.

Depression should be paid more attention to,it's not just a phase or something that can be brushed off. It's a serious mental health issue that can be disastrous. Too often, it's misunderstood or stigmatised, and this adds to the isolation and hopelessness that those of us living with depression feel on a daily basis.

People can get depression for various reasons. It could be due to genetic factors, traumatic life events, or even just overwhelming pressure and expectations societies place on us. For me, it feels like a combination of everything, like a storm that never seems to pass.

My main and common symptoms are, 
1) sudden mood change without any reason. Like sudden feeling heavy, sudden sad, sudden cry, sudden happy, sudden dancing, sudden behave like a baddie. All these happens withing a tike n for no valid reason. 
2) my common detailed behaves changing. For example, I like to use a certain emoji and I'm not doing it now ( there's more like this ) 
3) anything makes me sad or happy or heavy. Like there's a cheese n I see it I cry, and after sometime I see the same cheese n sing about cheese with a dancing tone. Then another time I see cheese n feel heavy like loaded of cheese stuck in my mind/body somewhere.

988,"My depression took my personality  During my (f 20) teenage years I dealt with depression. At some point during that, it became all I was. As many people know depression can make you loose interest in things that previously interested you.
I lost all my hobbies and a big chuck of my personality. I was a shell.

I've since overcome that part of my life and am left with this same shell. I dont particularly have anything that makes me me anymore. I don't have the patience/strength to really finish anything I start (eg artwork or writing) and when I don't finish it it brings me down more.

Essentialy I don't have a personality. I think I'm very boring and have crippling social skills. I don't know how I would go about trying to fix this.

My lack of social skills (due to isolating myself through arguably the most important part of my life, development wise) has also resulted in me loosing all my friends and unable to reconcile or make new ones.

I figure I can't be the only one going through this or something similar and wonder why this big part of this mental illness isn't really talked about

989,"A video game community made me depressed for over two years  

I wish this never happened to me, not even on my worst enemy.

When I was 15, I used to love a game called Sky, a game categorized as one of the nicest and most accepting communities out there on the internet, and people don‚Äôt usually get bad experiences there; but I did, and it was horrible. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I wanted to share the name because I was scared of more bullying, or people saying that I‚Äôm making this up, for not liking their community. That‚Äôs how stressed I was. 

I mainly played it for its musical mechanics, their piano. I used to play it so much that it was just the only thing that made me feel alive. Over time, I encountered many issues in the game so I wanted to rant about it in the community, not in a rude way. Issues with the game mechanics, and other things, like not wanting to be recorded without my consent when I play music. (It made many people there angry for some reason) I also tried proposing ideas to the developers of that game, to tweak a few things so that it‚Äôs easier for me to play, they said they‚Äôll get back to that, but never did. 

But because to those certain people in that community, it was a ridiculous thing to be stressed over. So they ridiculed me, and called me names, and said some of the worst shit you can think of, because that‚Äôs what the internet does; a massive cesspool, a place where you can anything you want, and not get consequences. A few remaining people still tried to help but were mostly puzzled, but didn‚Äôt get why I was so upset over the issue. I wish I knew that before I posted. I didn‚Äôt realize at the time that this interaction would truly put a dent in me. 

That was over 3 years ago. For a long time I wanted them to apologize for what they did. To apologize that they hurt me, so much that not even words can even describe my hurt. 

Then I realized; no one cares, I had to cope with the fact that I only had myself, that no one actually cares. I‚Äôve never felt so lonely, so isolated, dejected; it seemed as if no one else had my issues, which made me feel even more lonely, I then get angry and then I cry, and the cycle repeats. It wasnt fair; everyone else gets to be content with their games, while I get traumatized. I remember feeling hopeless for a long time. I wanted to disappear. I probably wouldn‚Äôt have mattered anyway, poof, gone in the wind, literally. Haha‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

I‚Äôm 18 now. I‚Äôm recovering, but recovery has been tough. I‚Äôm getting by day by day. I‚Äôm slowly accepting that some people are just assholes. And I just gotta move on, despite how painful it was for me. I‚Äôm choosing to do other better things in life for me. Hobbies like math, music (other instruments not related to sky), or art. It won‚Äôt resolve whatever happened but it suppresses my thoughts for a few hours, like alcohol but without the effects of being drunk. I cannot ever go to the past, and change what happened, what happened truly traumatized me, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll ever go away. 

I remember posting about this in this subreddit three years ago. it made me feel bad that no one replied, but wasn‚Äôt sure why it was like that.

My brother graduated from college in spring of 23. Since then, he's moved home with my parents. He mostly stays in bed, doesn't have a job or any prospects for getting one, and it takes a lot of encouragement to get him out of his room. 

He is on medication and his meds were adjust a couple weeks ago. He's in the process of looking for a therapist/ psychiatrist (actually my parents are in the process of finding one for him). My parents moved to be closer to my family and our children, which is a different state than where my brother grew up. 

He's asked my parents for help finding a therapist, a job of any kind, and opportunities to volunteer, but then gets upset when they help or tells them it doesn't really make a difference.

997,"Possible short depressive episodes  *Im gonna start this off by clarifying that I am planning on starting therapy very soon, so this isn‚Äôt me being desperate for information, im just curious about what y‚Äôall think*

So for what seems like years, I‚Äôve had depressive feelings usually at night, which I originally thought were just usual sad feelings, nothing to do with depression, as they didn‚Äôt really invade my life at all. 
Now, for the past few months, I‚Äôve started to have these thoughts throughout the day, and they‚Äôve seemed like mini depressive episodes, where I‚Äôd feel unusually down for anywhere between 1-3 days, with usually only a few days in between each, for a lack of better terms, ‚Äúepisode‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think this would be bipolar or anything, as I haven‚Äôt had any manic episodes in between, I would just feel more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. 
Looking up some stuff online, I kept seeing brief recurrent depression pop up, but those mentioned a much larger grace period between episodes than what I‚Äôve been experiencing. 

I‚Äôll also note that I‚Äôm 99% sure I have some form of social anxiety (again, I‚Äôm going to mention it to a therapist, and I‚Äôm not trying to self diagnose), where I‚Äôm not necessarily afraid of social situations, but I often have completely irrational thoughts about what other people‚Äôs actions mean, no matter how small said action might be (as in, my thoughts have been way beyond ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt like me‚Äù). And once in a while, I‚Äôll have what I call a panic episode, where for a day or two, my mind will be nearly completely consumed by worry/panic, as well as the previously mentioned irrational thoughts about other people‚Äôs feelings towards me.
To me, the weird part of this social anxiety aspect, is that I will be completely aware that the thoughts I‚Äôll have are irrational, yet my mind will still believe them, and make me anxious (although in the ‚Äúpanic episodes‚Äù that I‚Äôve mentioned, I‚Äôm much less aware).

1011,"Feeling happy  Hello everyone,

This is a short introduction towards ""feeling happy"".

The first thing you will need to do is ask yourself, why am i reading this?

Everyone will have another answer and so your experience might differ from what i describe.

The second thing you need to ask yourself, Am i happy with myself?

Now this can be tricky, cause people made you believe that you have to follow a certain pattern or behavior. There is only you, what is making you feel upset? Can you do anything to make you feel less upset? can you do anything to alleviate the stress induced by your thought created shortcommings? There is nothing wrong with you, you just do not fit in with the social standard and that is nothing to be ashamed about. You are here to experience the universe... . You should not feel guilty because you do not fit in. You want to cry? Cry! You want to go outside and shout your lungs out? Find a spot and do so. Then ask yourself, why did i do that?

The third thing to understand is what am i? What is driving my emotions? What is driving my needs and feelings? The only way forward is to accept that you have these emotions, that you have these feelings. Accepting yourself, accepting your needs and emotions, will get you further on the path towards enlightenment. 

The fourth thing you need to understand is that your entire being is small parts working together. Every cell in your body is linked up with your brain. The brain is the key towards you feeling happy. Most people just await daily interactions and thoughts into their final emotions and feelings, making you feel unhappy because you are not in control. However you are in control if you want to.

You are the energy housed in this earthly body. Why would you only be able to experience it? Why would you not have the ability to harvest some of the fruits that we are given? 

To start the whole thing i will give you a trick to reaching druglike states of mind.

The whole thing is dependent of the stated questions and your general state of mind.  


First time? Find yourself a place where you can focus on small things like your breathing or heartbeat.  
Keep in mind that you are the user of the computer that is called the brain.  
Find yourself a sweet spot where you can relax? Good. Now imagine that you are stroking different parts of your body. Try to imagine that you are stroking your arm with your ""thought"" fingers, while your body is completely relaxed. Now try to feel and touch different parts of your body. Feel the energy you create because you focus on that specific body part. Let your will create feelings in your body. Start to see where we are going? 

Now let us focus on the part of the brain that creates endorphins. I suggest you look this up using a search engine. It is a small gland like part of your brain. Imagine you milking it with all the above in mind. Imagine yourself milking drops of these  neurotransmitters, focusing on that part of the brain found on the cross section images found on the net. Imagine that now you are in control of more then just what should i eat and what am i going to do today.

Imagine you being in more control then ever now that you have learned you can create a natural drug already available in your brain. 

Endorphins are only 1 of many, you are the creator within your own universe.  
What do you want to create today?

What do you want to feel today?

Do not feel bad that you did not feel what i have described. Something is in your way. Find out what.

We all have way more capabilities concerning emotions and feelings, however no one teaches us to connect with ourselves.   


Connect the You, Yourself and I. ",Relaxed

I myself have also gone through a lot, so I understand, but I‚Äôve gotten out of the worst of it with the mentality that there‚Äôs always a rainbow at the end of the storm, and I‚Äôm able to be very positive even through hard times. 

On the other hand, if he gets down, it‚Äôs hard to bring him back up. He has a hard time opening up, and I‚Äôm probably the only person he fully talks openly with about his problems. I‚Äôm always happy to help and listen, and I give him that space anytime he needs it, but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has ever been through that ‚Äî a life of never being 100% happy and then finding happiness? 

I want him to be happy so badly, and I know our relationship is one of his greatest joys, but surely there‚Äôs gotta be a way for him to be happy generally!

I wanted to show it to a tattoo sub, cause I wanted to share the amazing work that the artist did. I even scrolled through the sub before posting, because I wanted to make sure the vibe was overall good.

So I posted it, and got mostly negative comments. While I do understand that the actual picture I wanted is unique and not for everyone, I wasn't expecting people to say it was a bad tattoo. I made sure to go to a really good and experienced tattoo artist. His work is awesome. But apparently my tattoo is badly done. 

I am just so down. I've been wanting this for so long, and now all I want to do is hide it. I will never be able to show my chest again..

1039,"My struggle with happiness   This is gonna be a long rant (psa this is not happy, but about happiness) 


I feel like I‚Äôm a very anxious person. I second guess every interaction to the 10th degree . And it‚Äôs only gotten worse as I get older. 

For some background, I used to be very shy as a kid, and in HS I wanted that to change so I fought hard to be more out going. I struggled a lot with self harm on and off aswell and suicidal thoughts. Unfortunately I never really had a solid friend group, and floated around. But I was very - authentic I would say as an individual, I didn‚Äôt care much and I was very smily, especially once I got my feet under me and my mental health started to improve I got along with everyone and was outgoing. 

Eventually I got so bored in HS I graduated early went and got another degree in music and then went to college the following year after I graduated with the goal of med school. Unfortunately this left me slightly isolated. 

Flash forward to college, I really wanted to reach out and make new friends find my place. I wanted to just enjoy life and grow as a person. I‚Äôm very Naive (as I‚Äôve now come to learn and have had others point out to me) , and I ended up with some people who seemed nice on the outside but we fought - all the time- and it took me nearly a year and a half to realize they weren‚Äôt healthy for me. They were very two faced individuals, and I felt either judged or talked about, one of the girls I was super close with, but she, as I later realized, took a lot of her anger at outside sources out on me. Eventually by the end, I stopped being silent about the mistreatment and started to speak up for myself. This led to a lot of raised voices and more issues. I eventually cut them off as much as I could (I live with one of them who also got me kicked out of the apt we share, at midnight and I had to sleep in a Walmart
parking lot in my car, for reasons no one could justify and even the school didn‚Äôt peruse it due to lack of a problem found) 

My mental health after this went to the garbage can. I was participating in self harm again, I felt unloved, and lonely. In the past 6 months I‚Äôve spent picking up the pieces for myself, I‚Äôve stoped self harm and that loneliness has been replaced with a lot of fear. I‚Äôm only comfortable when I‚Äôm alone. I‚Äôve grown so distrusting of everyone around me. I only have one friend left, she was also outcasted by the same group of negative people whom left me feeling this way. I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôve grown hateful to a lot of people around me. I‚Äôm burnt out with classes, and there are days where I just wish I never had to interact with anyone ever again other than my dog and my family. I feel like I‚Äôve taken one million steps back. I‚Äôve become someone I don‚Äôt like. 

I also have ADHD and Dyslexia, and it makes school 20 million times harder. I do have accommodations, but my focus is ass and it‚Äôs becoming an issue with day to day life problems. I‚Äôm forgetful and can‚Äôt keep up with my self or assignments. People fuss because I leave things behind everywhere, I can‚Äôt remember to check my email or send important document a half the time. 

At the end of the day I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I feel as though I‚Äôve lost myself. And I‚Äôm worried. I only feel happy when I go home for summers, my friend mentioned i change to a whole to person at home , in a good way. At college currently I cry everyday, I struggle to maintain health and I‚Äôm clinging to the hope that I push through and it all ends soon. But I guess I feel disappointed that college wasn‚Äôt what I was hoping it would be. Everyone talks about how it was the best times for them and for me I‚Äôm simply wishing to survive. I worry this mindset will haunt me in my future endeavors. 


I also tried different things, I went out a lot and partied a bit, which was fun, I‚Äôm not a big drinker so I wasn‚Äôt blacked out or anything  (I did enjoy it at one point) now I struggle to leave my room, I don‚Äôt want to be around anyone, or noise. I just want to stay in read my books and escape reality. I started dating this guy, and he treats me very well, he‚Äôs a source of comfort for me. I just feel terrible when he wants to go do something, it takes him convincing me a few times, he‚Äôs a very considerate person tho. It‚Äôs a blessing. 

I did scare the shit out of myself recently, it may sound dumb but I‚Äôm not a big smoker 
 and I have low tolerance. But I took edibles, with an old friend who I haven‚Äôt seen in 2 years , for the first time,  and no one told me the dosages. So I took a gummie. It was way too much. I experienced derealization for days after, I saw hallucinations, I threw up. My BF was there patting my back and just holding me. He still feels guilty. It basically has deterred me from wanting to drink smoke or touch weed ever again. I never want to go experience that again. 

That has left me rattled and wiht even more fear building up. I feel like I shed more tears than laugh now a days. The two people in my life I hold very dear at the moment because they care a lot about me. I just feel so lost, and I feel as tho my spark has been snuffed out.

However, now I‚Äôm alone, I don‚Äôt feel like doing any of those things. In fact, the only times I feel good are when I am with friends. 

Looking back on the relationship, I think that I used to be happy through the happiness of my ex, we always did what she wanted to do and I would always simply go along. This went on for so long that I now do not even know anymore what makes me happy, besides the happiness of other people. And ironically, it was also one of the main reasons that the relationship ended, since I couldn‚Äôt formulate what I personally wanted out of life.

To add to this, I recently started dating again. I met someone I really liked. For as long as it lasted, I was extremely happy and in love (unnaturally even, considering it only went on for a couple of weeks). As a result, I was finally doing fun things again, even when I was by myself. When it eventually ended, I was right back to being a couch potato every night‚Ä¶

     My parents had me when they were too young, all I remember of being young is being hit and crying while locked in rooms, by the time I was 8 I realized the way I was living was not how people normally lived, I think that‚Äôs when the depression really started, when everything began to come into perspective to myself. My mom is bipolar and probably a sociopath, grandparents were weird on her side, they weren‚Äôt bad to me but I think my mom is the way she is because of how they treated her. As for my father by the time I was 3 he was essentially out of the picture for 9-10 months of the year. Had a late growth spurt (16-17ish) and was bullied for my size basically up until that point. Years of being beaten, some of the most brutal being used as a bowling ball down a driveway into trash cans (chipped my tooth, luckily not an adult), and being beaten with metal poles (the ones that hold up a stereotypical backyard trampoline. All ambitions were crushed by my mom or stepdad (drill sergeant; figures) because they weren‚Äôt big enough, from Youtube, to Software Engineering, to Game Design, to fucking Cybersecurity, all because they wanted me to inherit my grandpas (mom side) construction company, or join the army. Grades were never good enough, if they‚Äôre weren‚Äôt A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs they had to be, if not all A‚Äôs they had to be, have all A‚Äôs? Well A-‚Äòs don‚Äôt count, besides physically abuse throughout my childhood I also received disproportionate punishments, say I disobeyed one order, even if I did not disobey I just didn‚Äôt execute in a timely manner, I could be grounded for upwards of 3 months. From everything, I would lose power to my room on dozens of occasions, WiFi most certainly was nearly 50% of the time disabled, toys were donated away. We weren‚Äôt poor, possibly upper middle class, but no luxuries were allowed, take a shower for more than 5 minutes a bucket of ice would be dumped on your head. Naturally I attempted to reach out for help, but then my mom would make up lies, tell one sided stories about how awful other people were. She convinced me my father didn‚Äôt love me or want me, that my grandma was a pedophile, that she wasn‚Äôt the manipulator but actually everyone else was. I‚Äôd have lulled myself by now, but when school started (high school) I moved schools essentially at the start of the year and I discovered wrestling, hate it, think it looks stupid or what, but my team and my coach saved me, not that I didn‚Äôt still get bullied or hazed, but I always had 20-25 brothers or sisters who would step in front of a gun for me. When I took my chance to escape junior year and come live with my dad the only thing I regret is I left the only people who I ever felt like were my family. Shortly after leaving one of the only people I care about in this world, besides probably my dad, my aunt/nephews (moms side), and sisters killed himself, I was already depressed but for the last year it has been eating me alive every waking moment that I should have been the one to die and not him, we were the same me and him, always laughing the loudest, doing goofy shit to get others to chuckle, taking center stage for the dumbest reasons. I should‚Äôve known he had the same problems I do, I never got to say goodbye because I left so quick I couldn‚Äôt even go to his funeral because in order to do so I would have to spend at least. 1.5 weeks with my mom, my dad said he wouldn‚Äôt take me otherwise.  The day he killed himself is coming up, and even though I‚Äôm free I feel lost and like I dug through rock bottom and found hell. I don‚Äôt even have the roadblock of the antidepressants anymore so I feel this all magnified. I don‚Äôt know if I want to kill myself but I want to die. Oh yeah I had a therapist, but a couple of months ago she tried to send me to IOP with the hint that it could lead to hospitalization. One of the things she told me that sticks with me is she told me that when I was talking to her it felt to her like a game of cat and mouse, like almost telling her about myself but then stopping thrilled me and all I got out of the therapy was self satisfaction. I think I do it subconsciously, but sometimes I think I‚Äôm just as manipulative as my mom and there‚Äôs nothing I can do to stop it. No one know this whole story, I can go deeper in details but  I don‚Äôt see the point this is already long enough.

1052,"I don't feel much happiness  I've been diagnosed with autism, ocd and social anxiety. I'm 19 and I love my close relatives (mom, grandma) and they love me. I also love experiencing art so much, although it happens rarely because I can barely focus enough to play videogames at the moment. Watching movies and reading books is difficult. These are the only moment I find happiness. I don't have any friends, never had any really. Fatigue from ocd, social anxiety and difficulty concentrating and studying makes going to school very difficult. I don't even know how I got to grade 13 honestly.

My dream is going to uni and studying philosophy and literature and other arts to be a philosopher and an artist. Until I finish high school I can't though and it will probably take me another year to do that and I can't focus on reading philosophy works, especially with pressure from school.

But being honest here as I struggle with mental health issues. This day has become definitely a sweet and sour day. I like it cause you get to tell you can celebrate with your friends your friendship, and share your love for your family members. 
Here comes the sour part though: I can‚Äôt help to feel alone. I can‚Äôt help to miss you. I saw one of our pictures, and I was just craving to hear your voice once more, to listen to you laughing and tell me how you‚Äôre doing. I wonder if I should call you, even if we‚Äôre really far away, or if we‚Äôve been without talking to each other for quite a long time. I wonder if you ever think of me, or miss me.

Yet I can't seem to let myself be happy.

Every time I am on cloud 9 and just life couldnt get any better...I fall into such a pit of depression, like i feel guilty for being so happy, that I just cant get out of. It's one thing for me to feel like this, my problem so I'll deal with it but its just not fair on my partner and i dont know how to stop it.

He ends up questioning everything, wondering where he went wrong but doesnt believe me when i say nothing has changed, understandably. This week for example, we have been amazing and just having a great life. One day, he was working and I had just finished so I met him at our business and had a great chat before I happily went home to walk the dog before he finished so we could have our evening together. Yet in those few hours when he was still working, i dont know what happened, i sat at home left with my own thoughts and just felt my mood plummet for no good reason. Now this was 4 days ago and we have barely spoken since. I dont know what to say, I mean what can I say? I know he wants a reason this is happening but i just cant give one, i guess im just a bit broken. 

This isnt fair to him though and I want nothing more than to go back to how we were last week, I just dont know how. He is my absolute world and i hate hurting him like this.

I have struggled with my mental health for years now but I just dont know why i keep feeling like this when I look at my life and i have everything I wanted (I mean, maybe winning the lottery would be great haha but we get by)

I'm not seeking out help here, but I feel like I don't anybody to talk to about what I feel. I feel betrayed by everyone on whom I trusted.

1061,"Struggling to make myself happy without others  For quite some time now after some unfortunate events its been hard to make myself happy without relying on anyone else. I just don't want to have to rely on anyone else for my happiness or enjoyment in life. The issue is nothing even compares to how I feel when i hangout with people who i find to be fun and talkative. A lot of my best moments were with very close friends or even my past best friends. With how it is now It feels hard to sleep for work despite work being fine. I like the people there and I enjoy being physically active but I still get anxiety the nights before. Even waking up in the morning I can feel my body already in a sad state. Then during work anxiety or sadness just ends up taking over sometimes. I also just felt more motivated in life to do things I enjoy.

There is certainly good to be had from the bad events that happened which snapped me into a mindset of no longer talking bad about myself. I use to always blame myself when something went wrong and treated myself like I killed someone. Now if things go wrong I try to treat myself well saying its okay and forgiving any mistakes I made in the situations. Its certainly prevented me from getting super depressed like I use to. The issue is despite all of this I can feel anxiety coming in at random without any thoughts to activate it. Even the sadness seems to be random but I guess it could still be the fact im coping from everything.

Again I just want to be okay with being alone and not feel the need to reach out to any past friendships that ended bad. I know some of them will hurt me as the people don't care to put in the effort to respect my boundaries or they just used me as a placeholder friend. At this rate I believe I'll make it out okay but right now its been miserable feeling all these emotions even a month or more after the fact. A lot of my comfort and calmness seemed to come from talking to these friends who I shared almost everything with. I really don't know what sources I can go to for help. Therapy is something I've thought about while I'm ahead but I don't have the money for it. I don't know if there are any alternatives I can look to. All I know is I wanna do my best to help myself now but this all seems pretty hard and painful.

I would look to my hobbies but my hobbies usually relate to hanging out with friends which I can't always do. Anything that I am interested in outside that ends up firing up with a lot of excitement for it until shortly after it blows out. Even if I want to start new things I get even more anxiety or It cost a decent amount of money. Plus the same effect of getting excited about it then losing all motivation happens. I suppose I could even try to find new friends if all else fails but I'm not sure how to meet anyone who is reasonably mature and willing to stay friends with me. 99% of my friends are online as I never end up connecting that well with people IRL. I tried looking to certain apps for this but I don't know which ones are great for meeting people. Additionally some of these apps have bots or people just want to hook up for fun.

Well if anyone reads this and gives some advice thanks in advance. I just really want to look for some hope and to be able to live okay. I don't want all these things to be a struggle. Hopefully this could even help someone else. Anyways thanks again.",Relaxed

1065,"I don‚Äôt want to be happy again.  This might be a suicide note, but I‚Äôm not sure.

I think I really fucked up and I can‚Äôt fix anything. I‚Äôve wasted so much time and I hate everything about myself. Every little fucking thing I hate. Everything I hate it hate hate hate. I am always in so much emotional pain, I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself anymore. I am quite literally useless. I can‚Äôt do this I seriously cannot. How do people even do this? 

I am a full time university student who enjoys writing and reading. I am not anything special to look at, and I haven‚Äôt done much that I am proud of. I think I have a few mental health issues, I used to be a really good student, and I think that overall, I am a decent person. I am also quite broke, and I have a few nice friends, but not the kind that you can share things with in complete ease. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been first for anything in my life; I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been loved more than I have loved someone else and I am so tired. I feel so gross and that there is no possibility that I will ever be put first; I am nobody‚Äôs friend, nobody‚Äôs person, nobody‚Äôs anything. I feel like I am rotting from the inside and living is so hard and painful. I haven‚Äôt even  been hugged in so long. I don‚Äôt want to be bothered because I don‚Äôt know what to believe anymore; everyone loves conditionally when I always love unconditionally and it hurts so bad. 

To sum a few things up, I don‚Äôt believe that a lot of people feel love for someone else; at least the kind that is unconditional. And if it does exist, I think it‚Äôs rare. I have thus far aways loved people unconditionally. They could turn into a three headed snake overnight and I would love them, etc. But in my life, and amongst my people, I am undoubtedly the only one. There is not a single person in my life who cares about me as much as I care about them. I am always singled out. People always seem to have one person that they can always turn to: whether brothers, parent/child, best friends, lovers. I don‚Äôt believe this kind of love is necessarily unconditional though, so I‚Äôm not envious of it. But even so, I don‚Äôt think I would ever know; I‚Äôve never been loved equally or more. 

If you are at all familiar with BPD, (borderline personality disorder) you will probably be familiar with what an FP is, (favourite person) and what an FP means to someone who is borderline. Well, though I am not BPD, the closest thing I can compare my feelings towards the people who have been substantial to me, is like having a FP. I have had 3 FP in my life thus far, and it was always to the point where I would literally die for them because of how strong my love for them was. Only issue was, my feelings (I don‚Äôt think) have never been reciprocated. I have never been loved like I love. 

I have recently come to the realization that I am utterly and completely alone in a world that I am already struggling in, and that none of it will get better. I am so tired of loving people and I am so tired of being so insufferable. I live for something I will never get: a love that will match mine. This is driving me to the brink of insanity. My grades have become terrible, my mental health is declining rapidly, I‚Äôve lost so much weight, I think I even hallucinate occasionally, (I was supposed to be getting evaluated for that) I am always asleep and I can‚Äôt even show up to work or school. 

This is so pathetic and I really want to die but without anyone even knowing. I don‚Äôt even want anyone to regard my death. I think all the happiness I‚Äôve ever felt was based on ‚Äúvalidation‚Äù that was false! I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs ever told me the truth before about how they really feel about me. Everyone who‚Äôs ever claimed to love me was lying, or regards me in a WAYYY lesser light than I have ever regarded them. Is this even possible? I am so fucked. I don‚Äôt believe anyone, I don‚Äôt trust anyone, I hate how my life turned out. 

I also cannot find a reason to be loved, which further makes things worse. I have a lot of scars, (both surgical and other) I am not special or talented, and I‚Äôm sad most of the time. 

I‚Äôll never be seen by anyone and I can‚Äôt even explain what ‚Äúseen‚Äù means. I did this to myself I think, and I may have even made it worse by completely isolating for the past year or so. I‚Äôve never given myself (aside from my FP) a chance to even know people either; that‚Äôs all because of insecurities though, and it always comes back to that. I am so lost‚ÄîI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever live a normal life. And I think I‚Äôll regret that too. I haven‚Äôt been happy ever. I actually don‚Äôt want to be happy again because that allows for a possibility that I‚Äôll be even sadder again/that everything has potential to be taken away from me. 

I don‚Äôt want to be happy again, I don‚Äôt ever want to feel secure, even though I am craving that, and even though it might save me. I don‚Äôt want to be happy again. I don‚Äôt want more fake reasons to keep living. And all that stuff about ‚Äúliving for myself‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing my own person,‚Äù yes, that would be really nice (albeit a little sad¬ø maybe) but I will never get there anyway cause even that is too hard for me. 

I have always loved/centered my life around the people I love (my FP, specifically.) And every single time, I am told I mean a lot to them, and every single time, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs taken back again after they find someone new. It feels a lot like a sick sense of emotional abandonment. Of course, I know that people don‚Äôt owe me love/commitment of any kind. All I‚Äôm saying is that I am sick by how hurt I am because of it. I don‚Äôt want to be this way‚ÄîI am so disgusted with myself. I should not feel this way. But I can‚Äôt help it, and I doubt that I‚Äôll ever change. I cannot keep living like this though, so I want to end it. 

This is going to be so hard and messy to clean up, so I‚Äôd rather just honour myself by allowing myself to die as the mess that I am.

1077,I‚Äôm never happy  Hey people of Reddit. I honestly don‚Äôt remember the last time I was truly happy. It seems like ever since my dad passed away I‚Äôve never been the same. I‚Äôve developed crazy mental health issues I was diagnosed with OCD and it‚Äôs been horrible these last 7 years. Everyday I wake up Either feeling neutral or just unhappy. And I feel so alone in this world. Even with my mom being very supportive and trying to help me the best she can I feel alone.  Even when I was with my ex girlfriend. I enjoyed her company and I loved her so much but I just wasn‚Äôt happy in general to get the full joy of having a girlfriend. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. So I kinda just live with it. Any thoughts?,Relaxed
1078,"why does happy things make me sad?  genuine question, 

i don‚Äôt know why but every time i see/hear/read  about anything happy, like people in love, happy families, etc. i always feel terrible because all that does is remind me of my own situation. 
thoughts like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never have what they have‚Äù or ‚ÄúIf only it worked out for me that way‚Äù keep popping into my head and it‚Äôs making it really hard for me to appreciate things. i dont know why i cant just be happy for other people and leave it at that? why do i always feel bad?",Relaxed

I live in an amazingly beautiful home, on a small acreage in a beautiful location. My husband loves me so much, and I him. We live with my mother, who we also love very much. I have worked to have my perfect career that is exciting and a little dangerous, but is also helping people. I have a nice car, nice clothing etc. But im just not happy. Im always anxious and depressed. I take on too much and am overwhelmed because of it, but if I don't I get bored and then my anxiety gets worse. Im not content with anything and upset most of the time. I just go with the idea that if i'm going to be miserable, I may as well be doing somthing because I will feel that way even if i'm sitting in bed like I want to. Im angry often because my career is in male dominated fields and the sexism I deal with sucks. Why cant I be happy in life, why is it not enough? Im so tired and I just want to feel good. I look at people who live what I would consider a boring life, and they are happy. They love their life and I want that so bad. But I cant say this to anyone because they will think I'm horrible. I am entitled and spoilt, and a lot of what I have comes from privilege, I know that but it still doesn't make me happy. I just want to feel joy...",Relaxed

My brain is constantly just on the go, I feel like it‚Äôs split in two.

1083,Im not happy with myself  Most of my issues these days relate to my addictions and my teeth especially. For my whole life ive had an unusual phobia of anything touching my teeth. This includes dentists and unfortunately regular hygene. About a year back it really started to catch up with me and my teeth are completely going to shit. Im not a nasty type person i shower every day i shave and i keep myself looking as nice as i can except for my teeth i fully break down when anything touches them and idk why. Its not like it hurts or anything ive just never liked things touching my teeth. Im unhealthily thin because i have to force myself to eat from this fear of anything touching my teeth. I have no idea where this cane from or if snything caused it but its always been an issue even when i was a little kid id throw a fit over having to brush my teeth and until i was probably 10 years old my mother would have to do it for me because i couldnt. Its not like i never have but its just hard for me to. Luckily i guess part of this anxiety of my teeth is im constantly running my tongue over my teeth so nothing ever gets like super built up on them because every time i eat i make sure nothings stuck on my teeth. That and mouthwash several times a day is usually all i can make myself do. Its lead to a lot of problems and insecurity for me and since about a year ago i started having pain in my teeth its lead me into some addictions to not feel the pain because it brings me close to a full panic attack when my teeth hurt. I know this definately sounds strange and ive never heard of snyone else dealing with this before (although i havent done too much research). Just wanting to vent and see if anyone knows if this could be a condition of some sort or if im just strange.,Relaxed

I dont feel happy and i havent been feeling good for a while, After getting out of school i couldnt find a job, Had no friends and feelt incredibly low reapeting too myself negative things often.

I eventually found a job after years and i feel better there but when i go home iam reminded once again of the Lonliness i feel as i have no friends too ask if they want too hang out with me.

It hits really hard and i have other problems like trust issues, low self esteem, overthinking things alot, worring my family and pen friends hate me for not talking too them for soo long. And worring alot in general.

I also have this voice that tells me negative things, and dunks on me pretty often saying how i dont deserve this dont deserve that,  if i would have too describe it its like a little blacked out devil with white eyes and a mouth that does its best too make me feel like iam useless, worthless and things like that.

Iam still hanging in there and wont commit sucide that wont happen, But hanging in there gets though. I just want too feel happy and good about myself but it dosent happen atleast not with how things are now.

I still burn for things and my interests so iam not emotionally numb or cant feel proud or happy at all but the negative thoughts highly weight out the good once.

Even when i walked around i was doing calf extensions and fidgeting the whole time. this lasted 10-30 minutes. stopped listening to my now very happy music and chugged 3 full glasses of water in about 30 seconds including refilling them. i eventually calmed down, with my chest hurting from breathing and my legs from moving. i literally felt like i had taken shots of adrenaline ans dopamine when it happened. this has never happened before, it was the most energy ive every had by 10 fold at least. what do you think it was?",Relaxed

1091,I‚Äôm scared of being happy  I have been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for about 6-7 years now And was officially diagnosed about a year and a half ago and I‚Äôm just terrified of my own happiness.  Every time things start going well for me and I start thinking that I‚Äôm better I eventually realize that I am doing well and then I get this dread of what‚Äôs coming that‚Äôs going to ruin my happiness and take me back to square one.  Like every time I‚Äôm happy I can‚Äôt shake the idea that it‚Äôs only temporary and that I can‚Äôt stay that way. This has lead to me becoming super pessimistic and all because I‚Äôd rather just stay sad than start to feel better and get my hopes up just for that hope to be shattered.  I know that I‚Äôm not taking my meds and I know that‚Äôs not helping but with my ADHD I struggle with taking it every day often times going months without even realizing that I haven‚Äôt been taking my meds.  And then when I get back on them I feel worse as a side effect of not taking them consistently.  Idk what to do because I‚Äôm tired of being sad all the time and not having a reason to be but I‚Äôm too scared to do anything about it at the same time.  I also have begun to push people away again because I don‚Äôt want to drag them down with me.  I worked so hard to stop doing that but I would rather just not let anyone close to me so that I don‚Äôt hurt them or get hurt worse myself.  I so desperately want someone to reach out and help me but I don‚Äôt want to have to relive the conversations that come with it again.  I don‚Äôt like talking about my past as it brings back memories I‚Äôd rather not think about.

I have friends, though, where everything isn‚Äôt as great. An online buddy lost his mother yesterday, so both him and his wife (they‚Äôre both in the discord server I‚Äôm in) are feeling pretty‚Ä¶ terrible.

And they‚Äôre allowed to do that, of course. And I‚Äôve sent them my best wishes and my condolences. But knowing that my friends feel awful makes me feel guilty about being happy. I know, logically, that I‚Äôm obviously not obligated to (and in fact, shouldn‚Äôt) start feeling bad out of pity. That‚Äôs not good for my own health and I‚Äôm pretty sure my friends wouldn‚Äôt want that, either.

I just feel like I can‚Äôt enjoy playing a video game right now, because I feel guilty. My friends just lost a really close person to them both, they feel awful, shouldn‚Äôt I‚Ä¶ do more? Again, I know in my head that I can‚Äôt really do anything. But that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I feel guilty about being happy. They‚Äôre unable to relax right now, and I somehow feel like I‚Äôm privileged because I can.

Can anyone else relate to this? Is there some psychological reason as to why I feel this way? And does anyone have any tips on how to deal with these feelings?

I want to add that of course it‚Äôs normal to feel sad when you have friends around you who are sad. And it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt care, I do care, a lot, and I‚Äôm really sorry for their loss and what they‚Äôre currently going through.

1101,"I should feel happy, but instead I'm spiraling, why?  This week, for me, was huge. I scored multiple job interviews after a year of being unemployed, and being a few months shy from homelessness. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I might be doing something right.

When I left my last interview, knowing it went really well, instead of feeling excited and happy, instead I felt dread, and overwhelming sadness.

I need a job, I've been sad because I need a job, a job is the answer to most of my problems. But now that a job is becoming a reality for me, I feel sad because, well, I'm going to be forced to be at a job. All day, every weekday.

I'm almost 30, but I feel like I was eighteen just a blink ago. I really don't understand where the time went. I feel like my life is speeding by me, and I'm terrified. Knowing that I'm going to be stuck slaving away in an office for someone isn't helping this feeling. 

I haven't accomplished anything I've wanted to in life so far. I want to see Europe and Japan with my mom. I want to publish a book of poetry. I want to buy a house. I want to support myself and my mom. I know this job is step one to achieving a lot of those goals because goals require money, but I see teenagers with YouTubes and TikToks who are way ahead of me in life. I know I'm far behind. I've always wanted to be an influencer, too, but have battled social anxiety most of my life. My mom always says to ""just go for it,"" but I can't bring myself to film a video, which makes me feel like even more of a failure. I don't even know how to drive and haven't taken the initiative to learn.

My grandparents are passing right now, and the realization that mentally I'm still a teen when the reality is that I'm thirty is really hitting me. The thought of my loved ones leaving me terrifies me, and the thought that one day I will be gone terrifies me more than anything. 

I feel very panicked and I feel like all my efforts are for nothing. Even with my new job, I feel like it will take years before I ever work my way up to a salary substantial enough to provide my mom and loved ones and me with the life I know we deserve. I'm afraid that by the time I'm making enough money to take us on trips or buy us a house, that it will be too late for her to enjoy those things fully because she will be so much older. 

I'm really sad, and I wish I didn't think these things. Maybe they are not true. Maybe there will be some miracle, and things will work out better for me than I could ever know. But the reality that this could be my life and that the reality that life is like this for so many is harrowing.

I'm supposed to be happy, but I just can't be. I'm so afraid to die. I'm devastated. I wish I had an easy life. I wish I could enjoy the things I want to. 

I don't want much. I just want to travel with the person I love the most, my mom, and try to provide a good life for us with the short time we have left. So many of my peers were born into money and take luxuries like travel or a place to live for granted.

It makes me so sad. I wish I was someone my family could be more proud of. I wish I was never born, so I didn't have to endure all this pain. It hurts to be here.",Relaxed

1103,"Will I ever feel happiness again?  Hello Reddit Reader!


Long text here, sorry.

Keep in mind English is not my first language.

I‚Äôm here to ask¬†for help and different experiences from that topic.¬†

I am still suffering from childhood Trauma. I am female, 27 years old and a christian.¬†

Since I can think of my dad got very drunk at weekends and when he gets very drunk he is very aggressive. As a child I was always scared of that, because he did and said things, e.g. he came up to my room and said ‚ÄúI have the order to kill all of you‚Äù, I was between 7-11 Years, after that I run to mum, was scared to death and slept at my neighbors that night, or he got abusive to my mom in front of me, that happens only two times.¬†

I was always afraid of weekends, because I didn‚Äôt know if he gets drunk or not.¬†

The next day we always pretended nothing happens and as a child I thought life is normal again.¬†

Other than that, my dad was and is a good man, he did and does everything for us and despite things he‚Äôs done to me and my family I still love him because of the good thing he did and does.

He also never admitted that he did something wrong and that made things hard for me. I went to therapy and had a conversation with my parents and told them how I feel and what they did to me as a child.

My mum did the best as she could with 3 kids (I am the youngest) but I am still mad that she didn‚Äôt do more e.g. talked to me when I was a child after the events to at least understand what happened, but now we ignored everything and played happy family.¬†

In the conversation I said to my dad that I‚Äôm forgiving him what he does to me for my own well-being. It was very hard for me and I cried like a baby.¬†

I think he didn‚Äôt understand it and that he did wrong to me and to us.¬†

But I forgave and went on with my life.¬†

Now at Christmas 2023 we had a family dinner, he got very drunk and until today I feel very uncomfortable, and it hits me back to when I was a child and I will get rude to my dad and I try to ignore him. My sister's boyfriend were there too, and they have drunk together and at some point he was so drunk that he tried to hit my sister's boyfriend for no reason. It was awful, I was very scared, said loudly that I will call the police, my mum was crying, my sister shocked, but her boyfriend could stop that and they left. The next day I was very, very mad and upset and confronted my dad, he couldn‚Äôt remember anything and I got more mad and told him that I‚Äôve told him month ago how I feel about when he gets drunk, but he only said I should leave and gets mad.¬†

So I left and until today I don‚Äôt talk to him and I also can‚Äôt. I got panic attacks again, flashbacks, I feel slightly depressed and trapped. I also imagine scenarios e.g. when I am getting married and my dad gets drunk there how I would act and how hurtful it would be for me. Thing like that I imagine and most of it nonsense‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt see any light at the end of the tunnel, and I‚Äôm mad at myself that it has so much power over me. It‚Äôs in the past, and I am responsible for my future, but I don‚Äôt know how.

I want my family in my life because I love them deeply, but I don‚Äôt know how to act about that. All I know is that my body and soul can‚Äôt handle it anymore when he‚Äôs drunk, even when it doesn‚Äôt happen a lot of time anymore.¬†

I also have been in christian counseling who helps with trauma. Faith is big part in my life and helps me a lot.¬†

I am so, so sorry for the long text you guys, I could write a lot more, but it would be too much I guess. It actually feels good to write it down.",Relaxed

1108,"Trigger Happy  Back in the day, I loved looking at slides‚Äîthose tiny squares with white paper edges that held the negative of a photograph that you then loaded into a carousel, and a projector magically threw the true image onto a movie screen, white sheet, or blank wall. But before then, while looking at those slides, each image was a warped representation of the world I knew, and I loved it.

In a negative, my brown hair was white, the same with my eyes. In negatives, a snowy landscape with a trail cut between snow-laced trees morphed into blackened volcanic ground, trails turned into scars, and tar-covered ashy trees. What can I say? I was a weird little kid.

I didn‚Äôt prefer the negative over the positive‚Äìboth the positive and the negative offer their own kind of magic. It was that I enjoyed a different perspective. Suddenly, I had a new way of looking at the same old.

As someone with Depression and Anxiety, I‚Äôve spent a lifetime learning and understanding triggers‚Äî lack of physical exercise, too many days without sunlight, or one whiff of mothballs in an antique shop and click!‚Äîdepression raises its ugly head. Likewise, too many people crammed into one place or too much place without any people, and Bam! Adrenaline kicks up my anxiety. See? Triggers‚Äìthose sudden situations that blindside you and revert you into feeling the worst experiences of your life. For me, it‚Äôs too much or too little of anything, and I get all triggered up.

The word, trigger, is appropriate. Like the sound of a gun, locked and loaded, the intensity of certain stimuli can also result in a sudden charge‚Äîa compulsion to run for your life or else a bare-knuckle brawl that you are both never prepared for and always unprepared for, leaving dread in its wake.

Triggers are part of my story, a snapshot of my experience and the negative of my life‚Äôs complete picture. I thought this was the true and only aspect, a pattern I would have to watch out for in the name of self-preservation. I was dead wrong.

Recently, I learned of another batch of stimuli opposite to triggers called glimmers. Immediately, the word creates an image of a dense dark wood with tiny lightning bugs zipping through the void.

Most people are familiar with the term, a glimmer of hope. In a moment surrounded by despair, a thin beam of light can penetrate a storm and guide us back to safety. These are glimmers.

Unlike triggers, glimmers are things that conjure happy times. Instead of instantaneous adrenaline spikes to get us to safety or save our knuckles from getting bloody, glimmers are things that calm us down, help us take a moment to breathe, make us smile, and reset our nervous system.

Usually, glimmers are associated with summertime (for some reason) and presented to people like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your favorite part about summer?‚Äù The regular glimmer response seems to be ‚Äúthe smell of newly cut grass‚Äù (which is super glimmery for me). 

However, in trying to understand my own glimmers, I had to take the concept out to the street (well, really, a couple of different text chains) and gather data. The text chain that got me started on this track was ‚ÄúName three of your Glimmers.‚Äù What followed was a list of nothing but hopeful and beautiful images.

‚ÄúHot coffee in the morning,‚Äù ‚ÄúNighttime baths,‚Äù ‚ÄúSitting outside at night watching the sunset,‚Äù ‚ÄúMy hands in dirt,‚Äù ‚ÄúLying on the sofa with (pet).‚Äù

Some of mine included the pop of a fire, bare feet in the grass, and rediscovering a forgotten song.

However, I was almost undone when someone wrote, ‚ÄúComing home, after a really long day to the smell of dinner thoughtfully ready, looking down on the lights from the top of a peak that took hours to get there, and the poke your baby gives from inside the womb.‚Äù

These are glimmers. These are what make life bearable and sweet. These are the other side to the snapshots of our lives.

I love the idea of searching for patterns of glimmers. But I don‚Äôt like the actual word for them. Glimmer sounds like a glimpse, as in a tiny sliver of sunlight that darkness will soon swallow up. Glimmer is not apt enough, but it‚Äôs a start.

My whole lifetime is a carousel of snapshot moments that, when inspected and understood, are sometimes horrific but often very good (yes, I know, rhyme intended).

Perhaps that is what we all need to do‚Äîinstead of reacting to negative stimuli and waiting to get beyond them, we need to specifically search for ways to trigger happiness‚Äìbecome a brand of glimmerati and spread a bit of shine to others. We need to glimmer!

What are some of your glimmer moments? Care to share?

1109,"It does get better! I'm happy  I have since deleted the post, but almost a year ago I posted how i was feeling really depressed and I wanted to give up, because I needed to tell someone and like a loser chose to go to reddit instead of a therapist. But anyway, since then i decided to recover from my eating disorder, and got help for it too. I'm making a lot of progress, and I'm a healthy weight, even if my mindset sometimes still resembles my ed mindset. I try to eat whatever I want to now :) I've entirely quit self harm, and I've only had the occasional urge. But since I've also gotten a boyfriend whom i love so so much, the urge hasn't really been there? I wouldn't want him to worry about me. My ex cheated on me and i had to break it off (late july ish?) , so I get kind of jealous and worried in this relationship, but my current boyfriend is such a sweet guy and he always makes me happy again. I met him at the art school I just started at, and i love going there! It's not too strict, and my classmates are so nice :) aaa I just needed somewhere to dump all this!

1112,"Would someone take the time to wish me a happy birthday? I don't have anyone and don't want to feel so alone today.  Today is my birthday and this sounds pretty sad, but I just want someone to wish me a happy birthday and maybe say something nice. I no longer have any friends or family left and just want some sort of human connection, even if it is just over Reddit, to make me feel just a bit less isolated and forgotten.

I have just endured so much lately and I don't have anyone to talk to or confide in, but I thought I could make it through today just fine. I was wrong. I feel stupid and pitiful while I'm typing this, but I just want to know someone is out there and understands.Getting to this point happened without me even realizing how solitary I had become until I was completely alone. I might as well lay it out, as just the act of typing it might be some sort of catharsis.

So how did I end up here? I started typing out damn near my whole life story, but that made this post so long that if I left it included there was an even smaller chance someone would read this. So highlights then? Abandoned by parents, raised by grandparents, abused by neighbor from ages 5 to 8, horrible abandonment issues, started getting into drugs, dropped out of high school, got a GED, some life happened, was totally Goth, some more life happened, made some music and art, now only Goth on the inside, started college, got married, wife left and grandparents arrested/institutionalized due to Alzheimer's/dementia in the same weekend, abruptly left college to move home to sort everything out, oh hey drugs, slowly watched my only family deteriorate before my eyes until they didn't even recognize me any longer, raging heroin addiction to try not to feel any of this, grandfather died, got in trouble with the law, lost everything I owned, homeless junkie interlude, lost almost 3 years of my life in jail/prison over less than $4,000 worth of bad checks, oops can't get a decent job due to criminal record, congestive heart failure, almost die, start getting my life back together, meet a nice girl, marry nice girl, grandmother dies, oh hey again drugs, finally got off the drugs, surprise wife departure, heart failure keeps getting worse, can barely walk, can't work anymore, no job, no insurance, no access to healthcare.

That about sums it up the backstory. I finally have gotten some healthcare and counseling. Sadly, I can no longer work. I'm trying to go through the disability process, but that takes a great deal of time. It is difficult without proper access to the doctors I need, but I'm getting there. I've also been clean for 4 years and I'm never going back to that dependence. Never before in my life did I ever feel like I was completely done with drugs, but this time it has really stuck. Haven't even had any cravings and now it never even crosses my mind. I'm finally in a good and stable place in my recovery.

Now I have other issues though. Poverty is very real. The threat of eviction looms nearly every month. Being able to afford the 12 different prescriptions I take is really hard and I find myself cutting pills in half because even $70 a month for medicine is a real challenge. I was able to get enrolled back in college and that is the plan of how to survive until I graduate and find work I'm physically able to handle. I'm working towards a career in counseling because I want to be able to use all of these nightmare experiences to help other people. I want to use what time I have left on this planet to help others and hopefully leave it better than I found it.

That is how you end up alone on your 40th birthday, typing on an ancient laptop that you pray survives a couple more months until you transfer schools and can get a replacement with financial aid funds. My family died. Drugs pushed everyone away for years except other drug addicts and an addict isn't anyone's friend. I am no longer able to work, so I don't have those human connections anymore. My wife had been my best friend, so when she surprised me by suddenly leaving the last person I had a connection with went with her. Now that my congestive heart failure has progressed just walking enough to shop for groceries, take out the trash, or getting the mail is a huge challenge, so just going out to walk around and meet people is near impossible. Having zero available disposable income also doesn't help. If I can hold on a couple more months and everything works out I'll be able to switch schools and have more aid options that will take care of my financial and healthcare needs. I'm just trying to hold on and it is so hard.

There is the abbreviated story if you somehow stopped on this post and actually read through everything. If you made it this far, thank you for listening. If you have the time to say happy birthday or say something nice I would really appreciate it. You really don't know how much it would mean to me. No one else is going to tell me today, so you might get to be the only person that wishes me a happy birthday. I don't get any presents or any cake. I don't get a birthday meal or get to do anything cool. I don't get to go anywhere or see anyone. There won't be any birthday cards in the mail or celebratory emails. That's okay though. If one person manages to take the time to read this and let me know there is someone, anyone out there then it'll be alright.

1113,"Does your happiness depend on how others treat you?

  Context:

I was hanging out with my friends today, and I was excited to share my story because I was trying to lighten the mood during lunch, as there wasn't much to talk about. However, I noticed that they weren't paying attention to what I was saying; instead, they were focused on other things without even looking at me or listening. This made me feel sad. I've also been ignored a few times when I talk to them or ask questions, but I tend to shrug it off. It felt awful. I hate feeling responsible for their moods. Now I'm beginning to overthink what I could have done wrong‚Äîdid I say something offensive or inappropriate? But when I reflect, I realize I didn't do anything that might have upset them. So I'm left wondering, do they secretly hate me? Am I annoying them? Am I talking too much? Am I being oversensitive?

1117,"I'll never be happy so what's the point?  I'm diagnosed with ADHD, have suspected autism, a mood disorder (diagnosed depression, but I think bipolar is an option), an on and off eating disorder, and likely have bpd but my therapist doesn't believe in personality disorders. I've been suffering severely since sixth grade, and up to that point I've had multiple suicide attempts that no one knew about. I had a major suicide attempt, and then ended up in a mental hospital for a week, which was the absolute worst week of my life. I will do anything but to go back. My family thinks I'm overdramatic for attempting suicide, but I've never felt open about my emotions to tell them anything of what I was feeling. I've been depressed on and off since middle school, and used to be very anxious until last year as well. That's when I experienced my first phase of feeling empty inside, and it just got severely worse ever since then. I'm a senior in high school now.  
I was always the kid that was bullied for no reason. I was bullied for being too quiet, for being too ugly, and they didn't hold back. I was always the kid that was left out when I tried to bond with other kids. I always had the best intentions. I had one friend in middle school who actually cared. I was miserable, but I knew I had her. Then in high school, we didn't talk. Covid hit my freshman year so I was on zoom, so when I went into school sophomore year, I was on top of the world. I had so many friends and it was great, until it wasn't and then all of my friends replaced me with the better, prettier version of me. I tried talking to them, but I was never valued enough for that to happen. So, I became closed off. I had a few friends, and I still have two friends who are low maintance friends.  
I suffered with an eating disorder on and off ever since eighth grade when my mom called me fat on a daily basis (I weighed less than I do now, and I'm a healthy weight). This ruined my body and I still feel the effects of it to this day, I am just significantly weaker than I used to be and my hair falls out very easily.  
I'm fat, ugly, dumb, and now crazy. I know that now I somehow have a lot of boys who like me, but I still feel that way. Antidepressants don't work for me, I took the genesight test and the only one that works for me caused suicidal thoughts and hallucinations. I am so afraid that everybody's going to leave me so I broke up with my boyfriend because to me he seemed to be less interested in me, and he told me that's not the case and I was told that I have too high expectations, but I can't help it. If I feel rejected, which I did multiple times and they don't give me a reason through actions of reassurance, then I'm just going to be miserable, and that's what happened. I've also tried to talk to him multiple times about what hurt me and he didn't change. I'm just, unlovable. I don't know what to do. I could be alone forever, but man I just want to not feel unloved. i know that I'll never have that because I'm not valued enough and due to my adhd, it is nearly impossible for me to function by myself. My social issues make it hard for me to connect with other people. I can't trust other people because I know that the will leave me because without fail they've left me before I was afriad of being left. I want to live alone, have no friends, and just function by myself, even though I know I don't want that. I want to be like everybody else. I want to not wake up one day and let all of this pain go away. I want to at least find something that won't make me miserable for life. ADHD meds help with functioning but not mood.

Hear me out:

Yes, of course it‚Äôs a choice when life is going well for you because your baseline is already happy. It‚Äùs actually EASY to choose happiness when you‚Äôre already happy.

But when you are facing a hardship in life or you are feeling depressed- You are not waking up to sunshine and rainbows and butterflies everyday. Choosing happiness might not be in the cards for you when you‚Äôre struggling just to make it through the day. And that might not seem fair, especially when you see the people around you enjoying life and living so lightly.

But believe it or not, the struggles you are faced with are fair because in the end they are a damn GIFT. It may not feel like it now, it feels horrible and heartbreaking and hopeless. But slowly but surely each day will get better and you will get through it and become a stronger person.

1120,"Question: Manic, Happy, or a Fraud?  Hello everyone!

I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for almost half of my life, and have just recently started addressing it with talk therapy. I also went to the psychiatrist for the first time yesterday. To my somewhat surprise, she diagnosed me with moderate to severe depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD. I've been gaslighted and have gaslighted myself of these symptoms for years so it's surreal to have someone diagnose me to my face like that. It felt like a huge relief. However, the psychiatrist asked me if I've ever had any manic episodes. To my knowledge, I haven't had any. However. 

This week, prior to the appointment with the psychiatrist, I did things that I've been trying to get myself to do for months that I have not been able to do. I went to the gym, and I went to the library. More than once in the week! It was insane and I had felt like omg, why couldn't I do this before? And I've had such a powerful and good few days, that I almost feel like either this is a manic episode, a hormonal shift (I'm on my period, lol) or something. Like I almost feel like a fraud saying I have depression because I've had such a happy few days and have done things I haven't been able to do in so so long. I even skateboarded which is something I've been dreaming to do for ages. I know this is a stretch and that I'm overthinking but with this random period of happiness and little accomplishments, it's making me feel like the depression never existed to begin with, or that I've been being dramatic or something.  I feel like this is mania, or some kind of weird.. something. 

It's really hard to articulate and put this into words so maybe someone will know what I mean??",Relaxed
1121,"Fluoxetine made me genuinely happy (Sorry long)   Hi, I don't really know who else to tell this to other than my boyfriend but I really feel like I want to tell people because I am so happy.

I have been depressed for around 12 years. I grew up with depression because I had a rough childhood with conflicts, deaths and economical struggles. Everything started to grow dull after the age of 6. I pretended to be someone else, felt anxious, insecure, depressed and hopeless. I never let myself be happy because I figured that it would just make me more vulnerable to hardships, I've barely ever felt any emotions ever and used to always pretend and act infront of other people to not seem rude or ungrateful. 
 I watched other people's reactions to different things and learned how to act in different situations.

I didn't even know this was unusual till about half a year ago when I met my now boyfriend. We talked about mental health one night and he helped me realize that I wasn't okay. I started doing more therapy and began eating fluoxetine and my bf encouraged me through it all and always stayed by my side and supported me through the roughest things I've gone through mentally.

 I am very sensitive to drugs used to treat mental health issues and react highly with usually the worst side effects. I started eating fluoxetine and the beginning was rough, everything got worse but in a way felt better. I can't explain it. I could suddenly for around 30 minutes feel intense emotions I've never felt before and I felt in a way more stable even though my suicidal thoughts and anxiety was worse. I think it maybe was because I had started to feel instead of blocking everything subconsciously. My doctor knew I was highly sensitive and tried to get me off the meds but we ended up getting into an argument. I wanted to keep eating the medicine since I felt it helped me and I felt good at times in ways I've never felt good, those times became more often the more time passed. Eventually we compromised that I would stop eating the medicine in a month if it still was the same. 

I know that it usually indicates that a medicine is not for you if you have bad side effects continuously. But my doctor wanted me to quit after two weeks when I had side effects, the medicine usually worsens symptoms in the beginning so I am not sure why she seemed so surprised.  

 I know I am reactive to medicine and this time I felt something positive from it in the beginning at times, this hasn't happened before when I have eaten other medications.

 I don't really trust her judgement enough sadly since she often has made false claims, given false information, caused many unnecessary arguments, is pushy and acts hostile towards patients.

I've eaten the medicine now for around 4-5 months. I have since doubled it to 20mg instead of 10mg everyday,  it was low but we wanted to start slowly since I am so reactive. I felt the best benefits when I started eating 20mg even though I reacted a bit in the beginning again but it passed fairly quickly. The worst part has passed in around 2+ months ago. It felt like years and it was terrible, close and accidental attempted suicide, but I made it through thanks to the support of my partner and my mother.  

Nowadays I feel more genuinely happy, stable, my mind is quiet and clear, I can think, I have started doing hobbies again, I pay attention to my loved ones, I see a future, I look forward to every day and what it has to offer me, I see beauty in everything.This is things I don't remember feeling in my entire life and it feels like I am experiencing life for the first time. I love to experience feelings genuinely, it feels great even though it was a bit overwhelming sometimes in the start and I am still getting used to it.

Of course, I still have some way to go but I feel like my suffering is soon completely over. I feel like I finally have finished coping and grieving after many years. 

I am writing this to also perhaps bring hope to other people suffering. I thought that I wouldn't become better and that this was just who I was. That was just the depression that had it's effect over me. You can break free but it will be tough. But you will feel so much better in the end and it will be so worth it.

If someone read this far thank you a lot :)! If you want someone to talk to or have any questions or anything about depression or medicarions, you can DM and ask me, would be happy to chat.

1122,"Certain ""happy feeling"" i miss and rarely get  Hello everyone, I've tried explaining this to my friends, but no one understood what i mean, or maybe i cant explain it.

There's this feeling, i cant describe it, it's like, when i feel it i feel safe, i start smiling, and i generally feel warm, and like.. my head feels sort of.. clearer? There's a certain feeling in the head that i associate with this feeling, i generally didn't feel this feeling, i just remembered it until some weeks ago, i remembered that theres was a feeling i had when i was a kid around like 7 or 8, that was many years ago (i am 17 now), i recently started to get this feeling more and more often, often when i simply look out the opened windows, seeing the sun shine, the trees move, and feeling the air on my skin and hear the cars drive, i also got this feeling once when i went into my dads working room, and the room had a certain smell, that i cant describe, but it took me back some years, when i last had smelled that, i belive that was nostalgia, mixed with ""that"" feeling. Or just now when i took one of my manga and opened and looked at it, and felt the wind on my skin, it felt like the first moment i got, bavk when i had this ""happy"" feeling all the time.
Also i kind of noticed this feeling getting weaker and weaker in terms of seasons. Like if its winter i am, i wouldn't say sady but kind of numb? I mean i still laugh, have fun, but that feeling isnt there, but when the weather slowly shifts to spring i get that feeling like on level max (sometimes), but as it starts to be hotter and hotter, that feeling slowly shifts, and. In ending summer i barely feel it, and then when deep winter hits, and i see the fog and feel the cold, i feel that feeling again, but its gone pretty fast, as it gets.. idk how to describe it. But when i start the weather to be warmer etc. The loop start at the top.

I also thought it would be important to mention that i think i may have adhd, because my doctor told me i may have it, and send me to a psychiatrist, (but i procrastinate the appointment so i never went there) but yeah.

I also kind of feel lonely? I mean i have friends, family, but i dont have any female conmections, i think maybe if i had a gf maybe this feeling would go away when i simply feel love.

1138,"Happy 25th Birthday to me!  TW: mentions of panic and suicide

Shortly before my 22nd birthday, I experienced my first panic attack, it was in my car while I was driving.
It was life-changing and horrifying.
I never knew this feeling of terror existed.
I developed severe anxiety and panic disorder as a result.
I lived in a cocoon of fear, it was constant and unforgiving.
I couldn‚Äôt drive ANYWHERE, not even up the street.
I couldn‚Äôt be driven anywhere either.
I couldn‚Äôt even be awake when my mom left the house, for fear of experiencing a panic attack alone and without her.

I used to keep myself awake for at least 36 hours and then take melatonin before I finally went to bed if I knew my mom had to leave that day (it was during peak Covid so she was working fully remote).
In my most shameful moment, my adrenaline kept me awake when my mom was about to go to an appointment and I physically blocked the door from her leaving.
She was a prisoner too.

The first time I truly had to face my fears was when our dog needed to go to the vet and I was, again, kept awake and I, again, blocked the door.
She called my therapist and he informed me if I didn‚Äôt allow her to leave, I would be forcibly taken from my home for psychiatric help.
I decided her leaving was better than me going and she went to the vet.
It wasn‚Äôt a pretty sight, I was truly BEGGING her to stay during those instances.
Through my constant apologies of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be like this‚Äù, I wasn‚Äôt letting her pass, until I did.

I used to tell myself I would go at least sit in my car and work on doing my exposure therapy, but months would go by and I never left the house.

The thoughts of killing myself were almost constant.
I truly wanted to die, if that meant being done with this.

I specifically remember sitting on my bed and wondering ‚Äúmaybe I should try meth or heroin, that would ‚Äòhelp‚Äô for sure‚Äù.
Then I thought ‚Äúif I ever feel those are my last options, I might as well just take my own life.‚Äù

It was unbearable.

I slooooowly grew in what I could handle, and I‚Äôm still growing.
I have been in therapy for three years now and have been on a rising dose of Zoloft since 2021.

With that, I have begun driving almost anxiety free and growing my ‚Äúbubble‚Äù of how far I am willing to go.
It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs my journey and I‚Äôm learning so much along the way.

My outlook, ability, and will to live are now the highest they have ever been.

I still struggle, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I WANT to be here.

My weight has spiraled throughout this time. I don‚Äôt say this in a fatphobic or stereotypically physically attractive way, but in a ‚Äúself-aware of my declining physical health‚Äù way. I now have the desire to lower my weight for sheer desire to be around for a long time. It certainly wasn‚Äôt always like this.

This is not over, it may never be over, but it‚Äôs better.
I now WANT to grow in my health, because I WANT to be here.

Instead of trying to figure out how I am going to take my life, I am figuring out how to continue it.

Instead of telling myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to clean the house so my mom won‚Äôt have to while receiving guests while she mourns‚Äù, I am figuring out how I am gonna go back to school and keep a positive schedule to thrive in.

Instead of deciding, I‚Äôm going to end it in my room upstairs and call someone right before I do so my mom doesn‚Äôt have to walk into the room her daughter committed suicide in or have to find my dead body, I am looking for a job so I can start saving to open a business once I graduate.

Instead of praying to God to make those around me care for me less so my death doesn‚Äôt hurt them so badly, I have gotten closer in my relationship with Him and even got baptized in June of 2022.

I am so forever thankful to every beautiful and amazing person around me who has gifted me their love every second of every day.
You are forever in my heart and I can‚Äôt wait to see where we go in this life ü§ç


The reason I say all of this is:

One, life can and WILL improve with proper treatment and care. YOU CAN DO IT!!
The world isn‚Äôt done with you yet, YOU HAVE PURPOSE!!
Please, I am pleading, DON‚ÄôT GIVE UP!!!!

Two, please reach out. You are so very very very worth every second of someone‚Äôs time.
Reach out to me! Let‚Äôs talk about it. I‚Äôm here ‚ù§Ô∏è

And three, I am overjoyed to see 25.
I absolutely and 100% did not believe I would make it this far, and I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing to age.
My gray hairs and I whole-heartedly welcome every day, every challenge, and every beautiful moment yet to come.
Aging is a gift I didn‚Äôt see being mine, and yet, here it is.

Happy Birthday to me! ü•≥üéÇ",Relaxed
1139,"I didn't tell my toxic brother happy birthday.  Hi, I just came in here to vent and see if im wrong. I (25) f did not tell my brother (33) m happy birthday. This all started in 2022 my bf and I moved back in with my mom to save up for a house because of constant bad rental situations. I knew this probably wasn't gonna be the best idea because the reason that I moved out is because it's a toxic environment.

 I moved out at the beginning of 2021because my brother acts like a fake thug and one day it finally caught up to him. He go into a fight with someone in the neighborhood and they completely broke all of his teeth including his jaw. After the fight he left the neighborhood and moved with some girl leaving my mom and I in the house during the pandemic with the  after causing problems in the neighborhood. A few days after the fight I went to walk my dog after work. It was probably about 12:00am I sat down on the porch and I see a dark figure approaching the house say ""If I would have snucked you you for anything it would have been your life"". I realized that it's the guy my brother got into a fight with and my brother is on the phone talking trash from a different location leaving me and my mom in the house to possibly face the consequences of his actions. I noticed that the guy also has something in his pocket, possibly a gun so I run in the house and tell my mom and she doesn't take it seriously.

 Fast forward to 2022 I have a bad rental situation and my my bf and I move back in with my mom. My bf and I began sleeping in the living room and my brother began waking us up every night around 2am with noise, lights and the smell of weed. I would ask him to turn it off nicely but he wouldn't stop so I literally had to start yelling to get him to stop. A few months into us moving in with my mom he started inviting guys over to sit outside with him at 2am to smoke weed and sit in the car, they would knock on the door at 2am or later yelling waking us up saying they're about to leave him if he doesn't come out or they would rush him outside. 

I finally had enough one night and asked my mom if she could ask him to stop bringing these guys to the house late at night because they're waking us up and he has gotten in multiple beefs with his so called friends. She talks to him and he gets mad and says "" I can do what I want"" then slams the door in her face. This pisses my bf off and causes him to go off on my brother for being disrespectful and waking us up every night, so my brother leaves for a few nights. He comes back and does the same thing, sits outside with these shady guys at 2am and smokes weed. This time my mom goes outside and asks them to leave. My brother goes comes inside and slams the door so hard that everyone in the house can hear it. 5 minutes later he goes downstairs and comes back up with what seems to be the clip of a gun in his pocket and says ""I'm about to put a stick in all of y'all asses"" meaning shoot everyone in the house. I went to tell my mom and she acted fake concerned then called my aunt, even though my mom and aunts all baby him and that didn't do anything. My bf and I decided to leave the house and I decided to stop talking to my brother. 

We came back a few days later to pick up groceries for him and my mom and I decided since he wants to threaten me  he can get the stuff he wants to eat in the list, which would be hard because he has no car or job. He notices that I stopped getting what he likes and slams the door. After that he started doing things to purposely get under my skin. He starts spitting on the deck in the path that I walk in, he recently threatened to ""blow my dogs head off"", he leaves his poop in the toilet so that we have to flush it and smokes in the house so we can smell it, which my mom hates and tells him to stop but he never does. Mind you, he's been doing this stuff all year. 

His birthday just came up and I decided not to say happy birthday to him and my dad began sending multiple texts, at least 20 messages to  telling me how horrible I am and ""karma is a bitch"", I just stopped responding am I wrong? My parents are big time enablers my brother is disrespectful to them both especially my dad he has threatened to kill my dad and come to his house and mess up his property mulitpule times but they still enable him and they bully me for keeping my distance. He bully's my mom as well even though she is sick and has Ms. He has been stealing from my mom since I was in middle school, basically her whole paycheck causeing lights to be cut off, water and every other bill you can name and he doesn't work or take care of his children even though the childrens moms beg. And they still after this try to bully me in to being close with him.There are so many other things my brother does but i just wanted to stay on topic. 

He has threatened to shoot the mother of his child with an illegal firearm through text and has stabbed a knife through her purse during an argument. He has stolen from my uncle who let him stay with him and got put out last year. And even ruined my cousins wedding reception. It doesn't seem like my parents care. Am I wrong for not telling him happy birthday? Because my parents are making me feel like shit, but I really don't feel like he deserves it. I feel like I have nobody to talk about this situation to, they all take his side. My parents are really toxic for enabling this behavior. My dad keeps saying that my brother looked so hurt. I've been depressed and stressed out dealing with this what can I do?

""What I like about my birthday is, each one reminds me that I'm year closer to death's cold embrace. Tama na kayo sa more birthdays to come.""

This was the caption I wrote last year to my birthday post. I had this thing that death is the only solution to never ending chaos inside my head.

I attempted to gave back the life that our God lent to me, twice. This year and last year. And it was always a month prior my date of birth, coincidentally. Who would have thought that a person like me that is considered as life of the party is just a facade and committed suicide twice. Alarming? Yes. But hear me out: 

Today, the first thing I did as I woke up was to play myself a birthday song. Cried my heart out while fixing my bed realizing how lucky I really am. My perception changed from the last three months, I would say.

I realized that throughout my whole existence, there are a lot of things to be grateful for. There are a lot of things to be celebrated and I admit that I took all of those for granted while I am being taken advantage all along. But not this time and that‚Äôs a promise. 

I am grateful for having my parents who are very supportive and understanding all the way. For understanding my mental health situation and for being my foundation when I‚Äôm about to break down. I am grateful to have true friends who are cheerful whenever I feel like I‚Äôm standing at the edge of cliff. For being my solid ground when I‚Äôm in a shakey situation. And I am grateful that God never turn His back to me and forgiving me for all of what I have committed. I‚Äôll make the most out of this new year of mine.

My journey as a 25-year-old stubborn and naive boy was a rough ride but it‚Äôs about to end. I am ready for another year that I‚Äôm about to face. Thinking of what I had to go through in order to be here, I knew that I need to put myself first before anyone else without making myself selfish in a sense. It‚Äôs time to prioritize my self worth and self value and build a higher walls.

Kung last year sabi ko ayaw ko na ng ‚Äúmbtc‚Äù ngayon I found my purpose by giving back and I‚Äôm ready for ‚Äúmore birthdays to come‚Äù.

even in school i somewhat dont like, i mean i got mates, but some days it feels we got a strong bond, other times i wonder if they really are my mates or just piers. lessons is overall okay, usually when im occupied i dont feel this void, for example today it snowed. lunch we all had snowball fights, people who i am friends with but just dont talk to i managed to interact with, which is kind of nice having a change of a friend group for a day. however other times i ask why even bother, with school or gym or whatever (mostly after 6pm i have these thoughts)

i do sometimes think its lack of a relationship, been single for a year and its weird because after that relatonship, the sparks of life just died down, disclaimer i broke up with her, yk wasnt that deep just highschool relationships. but now i cant even seem to find crushes. it might be due to previous porn addiction, or social media or whatever.

anyway point is for a few hours of my life i feel empty, no love or sparks, like a machiene, tommorow ill probally go back to feeling normal, looking forward for PE or some shit to occupy  my brain, thanks for reading ig, if u have any idea if what it is, maybe just lack of variety in hobbies, something deeper, let me know and ill answer any questions",Relaxed

1153,"Here i have written the answer to depression and the discovery of happiness. please discuss. thank you. Why be happy and defeat depression with no afterlife?:  Why be happy and defeat depression with no afterlife?:  
  
With no afterlife or ‚Äúreason‚Äù for being here, we are left with life as it lies before us preceding the opportunity we get to choose to interpret its results. The possibility for any event to occur is best described by a system of mathmatics that is near-impossible for both the layman and the genius to comprehend. The metaphysical reasons for these mathmatics is a debate that, while philosophically enjoyable, is ultimately unawnserable. But the impossibility of the existence of an answer is why we should be content with our ‚Äúreason‚Äù for existing in the first place.  
  
The likelihood of you existing, your history and even the event of you reading this text are so improbable that the existence of it alone should be celebrated. It may be that there is no definitive answer to the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and comprehension of this concept will always be a struggle, as this introspective odyssey has plagued us for millennia. But the fact that it is even being questioned is a testament to human greatness. Our ability to quest for truth evidences the beautiful luck we have to be the ones on the very journey we find ourselves contending to begin with.  
  
No matter how desperate life becomes, the fact that we can call it as such is so immeasurably preferable to nothingness that it exemplifies why true appreciation of the fact of existence is not only a reality, but is conducive and paramount to discovering an undefinable yet veraciously concluded unanimous happiness.  
  
Because of our ability to reason, only we as humans on this earth have the opportunity to experience this kind of contentment. And while human societies around the globe waste this life and destroy the opportunities we are afforded, you as an individual still have the ability to be joyfully purposeful. Be free of the moral chains that our societies cast you in.  
  
For you are real, so you are true. You are that truth we forever attempt to seek. You are what is beautiful in this temporal realm that is fortunate to be. You should do nothing but rejoice. You need not the metaphysical ‚Äúrealities‚Äù put forward by the potentially destructive socially created philosophies of religious entities to simply love the experience of our stunning pre-existence. They are inherently a misunderstanding of the beauty of being.  
  
Because to survive is optional, but to live is to succeed regardless of what may come after death. If I provide anyone reading this with anything it would be this: Use the capacities you are given as a living being as best as you can, because the best luck you‚Äôll ever ascertain is to live in the first place.  
  
I hope I contribute happiness to all those I meet. Ultimately, the words I have written before you is the opus I hope to leave behind to describe why I believe all of us deserve and are able to achieve ultimate happiness.  
  
Hate is therefore the enemy of this existential discovery, and for that love should forever be the ubiquitous retort.  
  
Gaz  
  
P.S: I struggled with mental health disorders due to losing my boyfriend and suffering severe physical health disorders, rendering me part-disabled. I have plenty reason to recede into a emotionally destructive pit.  
  
But I am forever happy now as a result of this here described eventual moral epiphany, and I write this so that others may defeat the horrific realities we can be forced to suffer. That is, I think, the only reason I survived.  
  
I promise only one thing as a result: You are human, and so you are beautiful. Thank you for reading.",Relaxed

1155,"My abuser is living a free and happy life.  TW SA/Grooming

So I was groomed for about a year, and emotionally manipulated by my sisters boyfriend who is 10 years older than me. I was 14 when I met him. He finally SAed me when I was 15, the night he proposed(Halloween night) 

I felt disgusted and ruined, but the thing is, I would have a few drinks with him my family, (primarily only him, though) and if I took him to court I know he would bring it up to backstab us and get my family into trouble. 

Im now 17. We are both male. 

I had very little support in regards to the whole thing, only my mom believing and listening to me. My sister took his side, and continued dating him for a year after. She forced it out of my that I wanted them to break up, and then she started hysterically crying, which made me feel like a horrible person.

Flash foward a year from then, I‚Äôm now 17, they‚Äôre separated, and he‚Äôs living a perfectly happy life with the family he told us hated and rejected him. I struggle with PTSD, and related agoraphobia. This is so unfair. Why does he get to be so happy, yet I need to take a benzo (prescribed) just to leave the house, or sometimes, even just sit in my house. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I only have my mom and one of my sisters in close proximity. I have one in person friend that I rarely speak to. It‚Äôs all just so fucked up.",Relaxed

1157,"I feel like I should be happy  I'm a 33 year old female, teacher (year 4) at a middle school. I live with a roommate who I get along with overall and appreciate in many ways. I have a boyfriend (36 m) who is ill from an autoimmune disease and is on dialysis awaiting a transplant. My parents are my grandparents who adopted me and are in their 80s but doing ok overall. I'm a bit overweight (very unhappy with this) but overall in good health aside from treating my hashimotos thyroid disorder. I'm on ADD meds and thyroid meds. My life is alright overall and I feel like I should be grateful for all that I have and I am, I do my best to practice gratitude and have small practices like mindfulness and prayer to help me along..also my best friend lives like 4 hours away and I dont have any close friends where I live. I do have one close friend but she lives an hour and a half away. I do have friends and a loose sense of community.. Looking from the outside in I have a good life...but for some reason I feel so utterly unhappy. I worked so hard to become a teacher and move to the mountains. My job isn't easy and I definitely want to work somewhere else.. but that's just part of my problem. 

Most people I meet think I'm super kind and good.. and I am I try to be I make an effort to be a good person. But internally... I struggle, I feel bitter, I hate my body, I feel exhausted all the time, I take things to seriously and I'm rather gloomy when it comes down to it. This makes me feel fake, Im not at all what people think I am on the inside. I do my best to be patient with my students and everyone else in my life and I feel drained constantly. I used to do yoga, be more creative (crafting/painting) going to shows/events.. I don't have any motivation to do that stuff hardly at all.. there are maybe a few weeks here and there when I suddenly feel like I can do things and have fun. Then inevitably it dissipates and I go back to feeling crummy and bored and dissatisfied. 

I feel like I have mild depression but I don't want to go on any pills because I'm worried about further weight gain. Last year I started this great gym routine and I was very consistent. From Jan to about May... in that time rather than losing weight (I started around 186) I ended up gaining weight and went up a size in my pants.. Im now around 204 lb on average. I was so devastated and confused. I was trying to eat well but struggling to cook for myself regularly because of my work schedule and then doing the gym from 5 to 6:30 or sometimes if I stayed late for work related things or had to run errands I wasn't getting home until 7pm. I'd have to shower and barely had time to cook. So I ate what I could when I could. I wasn't just purely eating sweets or carbs and I had protein drinks etc. I just was NOT losing weight. Part of the issue was the disregulated eating would lead to binge eating on the weekends often. So I stopped working out. It took up so much time and energy and I felt like I wasn't getting much out of it and I felt so disappointed and out of control with my eating habits I wanted to focus on that. 

I haven't found a good affordable yoga space like I had back where I grew up. And I lack the self discipline to do it at home (plus my space is small and cluttery). So aside from walking and stretching I don't exercise and haven't since May. 

I often feel overwhelmed,  bored and annoyed with the direction my life took. I make enough money to buy decent food, buy basic things I need/want (nothing extravagant). I want to live with my partner in a nice home centralized in the city/town where I work. Yet this can't happen because housing is unaffordable and my partner currently has his parents staying with him indefinitely. 

I'm just not sure how to navigate my life. I have no idea what my future holds and my lack of motivation and increasing apathy have me going home and crawling into bed to read, watch TV or scroll on my phone. My healthy habits and hobbies feel like too much to do or just not worth it. I'm just stuck in a rut and have been for years. I started a meal plan with Factor to make feeding myself easier (I literally only ate applesauce last night). I have intentions to go back to the gym but I really don't want to but I know I need to because I can't stand my body. I want to do better for myself and feel happy again. 

Can anyone relate, have you found a way out of the rut?

I started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist last year and that has seemed to make it worse I've now been in the hospital 3 time and probably have had like 6 failed attempts in the past year. 2 in like the past week trying to overdose on meds. Idk what to do. Early today I was listening to reddit stories and one talked about a funeral being cheaper then a hospital visit and it's just really hard to not act on that information. I'm highly aware that I'm the only one that can fix my life but building the habits that would help has been very hard. Sometimes I can a couple stable months but then spiral back down. I've trttt6 yy tied like 6 different anti-psychotics and another 5 additional meds. At one point doing 10 hours of therapy a weeks. What's the point of trying if nothing is working. What's weird is from an outside perspective my life is getting better but mentally it's not. In 2020 I was working 60+hours making 14k a year and homeless.

I‚Äôm not in therapy anymore and I‚Äôm doing pretty well‚ÄîI just noticed that whenever I‚Äôm actually feeling good,  happy, or am just having a good day, I always get a looming sense of dread that comes with it. In recent years, there were a couple of major instances that I really got my hopes up before having the rug pulled out from under me.* I think as a result, whenever I feel excited or genuinely happy, I get suspicious and think that something is going to go wrong, and take this feeling away from me. It‚Äôs not entirely self-sabotaging, I‚Äôd just like to enjoy feeling light and happy without the side of anxiety. I don‚Äôt know if this is even the right flair, but does anyone have any advice on how to stop fearing that my joy will be taken away from me?

*I‚Äôm a freshman in junior college. In my senior year, I was accepted to my dream school in Ireland‚ÄîI got the acceptance later than my peers. I told everyone that I got accepted because I was excited. After I graduated, literally in the summer, I got an email saying that my offer was rescinded.

1161,"I just feel like I'll never have a happy work life.  I'm a hard-worker but I've never had a good handle on stress. I feel like it's part biology from my mom since she has history of anxiety and depression too but also that I never really did work for me I did work for survival. Ever since I started working I feel like I've only done it to keep food on the table and a roof over my head.

I knew in high school I didn't want to go to college because I know all I'd do is just do the work to get it over with and not really pick things I wanted to do. Well I graduated with a major that I knew would satisfy my family but not me (English)( Bachelor's) I was too far along when I decided I didn't want to do more so I sulked and finished. I tried to use it after I graduated but then the jobs basically say ""we just want a little more schooling out of you before we hire you"" which I knew once I stepped out of school I refused to go back.

Years later I stayed in retail for nearly 8 years until late last year where I thought I finally escaped just to land in an at home job where it's basically retail without people being physically in front of you. I don't mind working with others but the public makes me anxious. I don't have a filter with people anymore. If you are rude to me or piss me off I'll be rude right back, I even snapped at my boss from my last job who micromanaged me to my break point. 

 I got career counseling, which helped my resume be seen a little more and some interviews but I haven't found anything that fits well.

I have a hobby after work but with my schedule and all this time spent I am exhausted and even on my off days all I want to do is catch up on sleep I'm too depressed to touch my hobby anymore. And with my current job you have to schedule bid and have good scoring to get better placement. I'm about to come out of grace period which I know I'm never going to have a good score once that is gone. I've been wanting to leave this new job since day 1 but going back to retail would literally break my soul. 

I know they say it's okay to not have life figured out but I'm about to be 30 soon. I'm trying to work on things on my own without family influence yet I feel like I'm in the huge void of self doubt that I'll never find a job that will make me happy.

Then at school, there's assignments that stress me out, managing a social life, and dealing with teachers who don't care enough about their students.  
  
There's no places like stores, parks, woods, etc that are comfortable to me. They all are either overwhelming or make me super bored, even when I bring stuff to keep my occupied. And being at a friend's house is out of the question, since I hate being in other people's houses.

1165,"How i went from verge of suicide to being happy  As I have been reading though a lot of the posts, I‚Äôve realized most people who are suicidal are lacking motivation to live. This affected me as well. 

when i was in 10th grade i failed 2 classes because all i could think about was what is the purpose of school if I‚Äôm gonna end up in a job I don‚Äôt really care about and not be as happy as I am now with my friends. I got close to suicide multiple times. I live in the south so I managed to get a loaded gun to my head at one point.  During that event I thought to myself: ‚ÄúLet me figure out a way to maybe be happy and If i can‚Äôt by the end of this summer i will kill myself‚Äù. So, I spent a lot of my summer eating alone going on walks just wandering thinking about life and if it was worth living. 

I thought about everything. Myself from an unbiased perspective, others, the thoughts i didn‚Äôt want to think of, nihilism, morals, nature, religion, and so much more. I sacrificed a lot to just think.

Eventually I started to notice patterns. When i was a good person and made others happy that‚Äôs when I was at my happiest. I noticed I had infinite motivation when It came to things that i wanted to do. Many of those things I had only discovered through thinking. I also discovered how as an animal I had a need for food, shelter, and everything else that‚Äôs needed to extend your bloodline.

So i decided to combine those 3 things and make them my life goal.

So that‚Äôs where I get my motivation for life. If i die suddenly I will die happy because I‚Äôm chasing what I love.

Obviously to combine those 3 things into a dream means it‚Äôs gonna hard af and i have not achieved it yet but i fully believe i will. 

So what i propose to everyone out there lacking motivation to live is to:

1. Think a shit ton and think about things you don‚Äôt want to think about. do not run from reality.

2. be a good person (but don‚Äôt get walked over)

3. Take in account our society and how you need money and possibly make that a side affect of your dream.

4. Ignore everyones and your own doubts and try to achieve what you want to achieve.

Obviously I‚Äôm my own person so this may not help you it may not. Hopefully it helps someone. Remember suicide is never the answer. You just have to think more.

I was hit two weeks ago by a drunk driver, car totaled, am recovering from a concussion, and my life is a mess. I'm gonna face down a legal battle soon which I am not looking forward to. I've been through so much these past two and a half years. I battled and recovered from a brain tumor, lost most of my hearing, death of a close friend, lost my job, and financial problems here and there. Its like each time I got back up, life seemed to have to knock me down again. 

I was happy some time ago and I'm basically just imagining that same feeling of when I was truly happy. I'm not imagining the circumstances or the places, just the feeling itself. 

I just need a moment to forget about what I desperately need right now. To be able to relive that moment in my life where I felt like I needed nothing, and all I had to say was thank you and I love you. Above all, the time where my confidence was unshatterable and my mind and body was at its peak.

Whenever I do it, even if its not 100% real, I stop hating my life, doubting my relationships, and give myself some grace. Itnmakes me feel like my life is still worth living and because inknow what this feeling is, it'll come back to me for real some day.

Right now, I'm not okay. I'm not eating, I'm not sleeping, I'm not focusing, and I'm waiting to see my new therapist next week.

It worked for a little bit and gave my mind and body the strength to go to work to pay bills (not salaried), and get myself to eat.

I won't go into what happened or to who. But I hurt someone really badly and we both want to get back to a better place. And after two months they still don't know how to feel about me, and I'm kind of worried they will never see the person I've grown into, only the person who hurt them. I'm scared of that. I don't want them to hurt like that.

Right now we're taking a break, but have been slowly working on it, and they struggle every day seeing me on social media talking about my healing journey. They told me that every word sounds like a lie. That they can't reconcile this new happy, healthy person with the person who hurt them. Two months and no progress in that opinion has been made.

I'm willing to stick with them until we both decide if things can or will ever be fixed, but I feel bad because I'm actually doing really well mentally for the first time in literally forever. My self esteem is going up, I have a new therapist who has actually helped me this time, I'm on meds to help manage my anxiety and adhd so I feel so much more confident in my day to day. Meanwhile they're still hurting.

I feel like I don't deserve the happiness I have because it feels like it's costing theirs. Like why am I so happy and doing so well but they're still hurting so badly. I'm so confused. And I don't know what to do. It sucks. I just want to hug them and tell them how sorry I am even though I know that won't help. I just want what we had back so badly and I am so ashamed of myself for making them feel like this.

It‚Äôs weird, because I can go out and laugh and enjoy a good time with the boys. But when I get back to my dorm and it‚Äôs me alone, I feel so sad and lost and alone. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me‚Ä¶ I can put my phone down for hours on end and no one will have texted me. My friends all have girlfriends or sneaky links (not for me, but I don‚Äôt judge) and I feel like the ambitious dreams me and my friends have made will never occur because they will have moved on to live with their loved ones while I lay numb in my room succumbing to the painful loneliness that is my life on a day to day basis. 

I feel as if I was made to give love and compassion to my friends so that they may be the best people that they can be, but at the same time, I feel as if I no one ever matches the love that I give to people. I genuinely hate myself despite loving the person I became. I feel so alone I don‚Äôt even have my own back. I want to love but also feel loved, both by myself and others. I am so happy for my friends but at the same time, it makes me just feel lonely when that all are on the phone talking to their loved ones or hanging out with them because it reminds me of how lonely I am. 

It hurts even more because I feel like the masses will never even consider me because of the way I look. I genuinely believe god‚Äôs goal when making me was to create the most loving, yet least livable creature ever created. I just feel like the way I look on top of zero self confidence serve as a 80/20 split on why I will never experience love in my lifetime

I hate talking about my feelings because it makes me feel weak, but I have no therapist and these feelings are becoming bore than I can bare. My parents love me, but the last time I told my mom about the way I was feeling she thought I was going to off myself, so I feel as if posting this anonymously  is the only way I can get this off my chest without worrying her.

TLDR: I am happy with my friends, but seeing them living their happy lives with the lives of their lives makes me feel lonely, as if I will never experience what they have. I feel like I was only meant to give love and not receive, mostly because I am ugly asf. On top of this I also have no self confidence so I feel like I will never get the love that I give on a daily basis.

Its there constantly, but becomes worse when I am with my friends and trying to enjoy myself.

i have a lot of friends who live 2-3 hours away, so I only see them one a month, so it's very important I enjoy those few visits, but I can't. Whenever I meet with them, that voice become way worse and I can't let it go. The longer I am with my friends, the worse it gets, until I can't take it and either leave or get a panic attack. And even when that happens, I just do it alone, because I don't want to bother them with my problems. It's also because that voice latches on to anything they say and do, and twists it into something negativ about me. Like one of my friends will choose to partner op with another one of my friends in a game. The voice then tells me it's because they hate me and because I am so useless no one would want to be with me, they don't even want me to be there and so on, until I fall deeper and deeper into a spiral of self hate. 

I have tried to speak with a therapist about it and has gone to one in a little over a year now, but she wants to keep digging into the reasons that voice is there, but I already know why (bullying and isolation in school), so we just keep going in circles without me getting tools to help me.

I do somewhat enjoy it, but it's not something I look forward to anymore, as it used to be pre-2023.

I (22F) just found out I'm pregnant with my husband (23M) and I's second child today. We have a little one, who i love more than anything, but I can't help but feel a rush of emotions right now.

With a little back story, I've always wanted just one child, and my husband always wanted more than one. This is something we've talked about back and forth, and I normally would end the conversation with ""We'll see"" or ""Maybe."" Though deep down, I was perfectly content with one. After having our first born, it was a real shock for me because I nearly died from pre-eclampsia. Since then, my decision was solid and final about having one child.

My feelings for the new baby on the way are no way positive at all, and despite using birth control, it still happened. I've been crying about it all day, and really feel a detachment to the unborn child. 

My thoughts has included harming myself, in a plethora of ways. I don't want to be pregnant again, though I dont think I could ever bring myself to do an abortion,  because in a way, this is my husband's baby too.

1229,"Joy Has To Be Found Today, Not Tomorrow.  In the past, I‚Äôve struggled.

I‚Äôve spent days in bed crushed under the sheer weight of existence. I‚Äôve drowned in thoughts. I‚Äôve been angry and resentful at my own shortcomings. I‚Äôve felt guilt and shame for being sad when others have it so much worse than me.

The last 6 years have been spent trying to discover what it means to live a good life. Here are some of the most important realisations I‚Äôve come upon‚Ä¶

**You are not your thoughts:** The voice that speaks in your head is not you. You are the one who hears it speak. Don‚Äôt identify with what your mind says any more than you identify with what someone on the street says. This is one of the most liberating truths to know.

**Action is the antidote to anxiety:** You‚Äôre not afraid of the future when you‚Äôre moving yourself toward it. Do something. Anything. You‚Äôll feel better.

**Loneliness is a kind of tax you have to pay to atone for a certain complexity of mind:** The more unique you are, the fewer people are like you, the fewer people will ‚Äúget‚Äù you. This is fine. The increase in depth of insight is worth the entry price.

**Your weirdness is your competitive advantage:** No one can beat you at being you. Embrace your traumas, life experiences, scars, funny accent, whatever it is. This is what sets you apart. The weirder you are; the more unique you are; the more competitive & interesting you are.

**Joy has to be found today, not tomorrow:** If you can‚Äôt be happy with a coffee, you won‚Äôt be happy with a yacht. Choose to find joy in today, it‚Äôs there waiting for you.

**Never lie:** Whether by omission or commission, lying degrades your virtue. Your internal sense of self worth is keeping check, even if you aren‚Äôt. Telling the truth is a superpower, it works for everything. Start being radically honest today and your life will change.

**Keep promises to yourself:** Your faith in your own word is vital. If you can‚Äôt trust yourself, you‚Äôre making a chaotic world even more difficult to navigate. Build your self-trust up with small promises. Over time you will be able to take on bigger challenges.

**Most problems are easily fixed:** 90% of issues can be solved by a good sleep, a glass of water, a gym session, a walk outdoors or a chat with a friend.

**Your framing is everything:** Feeling like you just finished a workout in the gym is amazing. If you had the exact same feeling spontaneously whilst sat in traffic, you‚Äôd be terrified. Learn to control how you frame situations. Life itself is but what you deem it.

**Don‚Äôt practice what you do not want to become:** Every action you take is a vote for the kind of person you‚Äôre going to be in the future. If you do a thing today, it‚Äôs more likely you‚Äôll do it tomorrow. This includes negative self-talk and a lack of compassion for yourself. Treat your habits with requisite care.

**Gratitude is the foundation of happiness:** When you‚Äôre struggling, focus your attention and energy outward, not inward. You‚Äôre alive. Breathing. Feeling. The likelihood of this happening is basically zero. Take a moment to be thankful for the wind on your skin and the breath in your lungs. Sooner or later you won‚Äôt feel it any more.

**You are the sky, everything else is just the weather:** Your anger, frustration, anxiety & everything else is just a visitor in your mind. Sometimes it gets cloudy so you can‚Äôt see the sun, but it‚Äôs always there if you just breathe and let go of what is holding the clouds in place.",Relaxed

I want to stop. I want to find happiness outside of that life. Because I realize, I am not that far away from exiting my teen years, and I still don't feel like my life has reached the meaning I thought it would. 

I still spend all my time playing video games. I still rarely shop for my own clothes. I hardly have any sense of customization or self. It makes me feel sad. 

I don't know how to start. I feel like I want to live my life, but I don't feel enough motivation to do so. I want to be my happiest self possible, but I have no idea where to begin or what to do. 

I also feel very lonely. I haven't talked to anyone else outside of school in 7 years now, and I don't know anyone on social media. It feels like I just don't get to do all the typical teenage things that I thought I would be doing. It's just a mundane, boring and lonely life of playing video games. 

I also am transgender. For a while, my survival instincts kicked in and created an emotionless shell of myself to protect myself in fear of my true self, and hatefulness. This has led me to being afraid to be expressive.

So, this is a weird post, but I have not felt any happiness or joy in the last 8 months. I do not what it is, but I simly do not feel emotions anymore. There have been some issues lately: Break up, health problems, moving to another country, no friends etc.

However, the main problem of not feeling joy or happiness has been around longer.

I do not enjoy my hobbies anymore, stopped doing sports or working out. Even food does not taste good anymore. I stopped eating mostly and just consume very little.

I still perform well at work etc., but I feel off.

1242,"Over-Comparison: The Path of Envy and Thief of Joy  All life is designed to survive. From the moment you are born, you will have to compete with others for various resources. Food, water, relationships, love, status, and all the ingredients of a society. There are two primary ways to collect those resources, cooperate with others or compete with them. Those are not opposing terms. There are healthy and unhealthy methods of both cooperation and competition. Modern human society was born on the basis of a foundation between the balance of those two strategies.   
However, modern societies in an effort to keep up with the fast pace of industrialization has opted to lean more into competition. To compete, we need to compare ourselves with others so that we can set standards of what we want to accomplish. We want to compete with friends, family, role models, rivals, strangers, and enemies. All in the effort to prove our abilities. Such as when we compare ourselves to celebrities on the television because we wish he had their looks, money, or fame. Or when we scroll our favorite social media apps and see the happy moments of our friends. Or amongst men, muscle worship.

While comparison might be natural that doesn't necessarily mean that it's healthy. A study of comparison on social networking sites suggests that social comparison orientation negatively influenced psychological well-being. Self-esteem taking the biggest hit. With nearly 8 billion people on the earth, you have plenty of people to compare yourself with. Bodybuilders, artists, models, CEO's: all people we can follow at our fingertips and take a peak into their lives. Extraordinary people who set extraordinary expectations from themselves. Lives that can't even be imagined by ordinary people. So much that it feels like a taunt.   
**The Mechanics of Social Comparison**  
Social comparison theory can explain how and why people value their worth by assessing how they compare to others. We tend to make all kinds of judgements about ourselves and it all has to do with how we analyze our self in relation to others. For example, you may have just started a new internship at a company. You are trained or introduced into your expected daily tasks and as you evaluate your skills and progress, you will compare your performance to other people at the job.   
It usually starts by noticing the best person in the room. Seeing what they can do and how they perform. If we find our abilities don't measure up to their talents, we might be driven to achieve more and improve our abilities. Then, we'll start to establish peer groups with people based around our ability level. This gives us something to work with.   
**Upward Social Comparison**  
The is how we compare ourselves the most. We notice what others can do when we can't do it ourselves. We mentally establish they're better than us, and often focus on the desire to improve our current status or level of ability. Going back to the job example, we might focus on the people who are able to complete complex tasks much faster than the others. So we try to focus on increasing our speed so that we can be faster than them. However, without knowing the mechanics it can lead to failure.   
**Downward Social Comparison**  
This is more relatively uncommon unless we are in a certain mood. We notice what other people can't do and compare it to something that is relatively easy for us. These downward comparisons are often centered around making ourselves feel better about our abilities or traits. We might not be great, but at least we are better than that person. In any hierarchy, nobody wants to be at the bottom. They may make us feel better about ourselves, but they feel terrible when everyone seems better than them.   
**The Consequences of Over-Comparison: Walking the Path of Envy**  
When we begin to compare ourselves too often, we spiral into a thinking pattern I've termed the path of envy. Essentially, too much comparison will lead to feedback loops in your brain that will slowly deteriorate your mental health. It starts with basing our goals on someone else's performance and creating unrealistic expectations.   
**Creating Unrealistic Expectations**  
It usually begins with either admiration or awe. Admiration is when you observe someone and become impressed at the immense talent or skill for something. Awe is a sort of combination of both surprise and fear. Instead of being impressed at someone's talent, you are surprised that they were capable of it and may become intimidated by them. Either emotion usually brings up the thoughts, ""I want to try that"" or ""I can do that."" So then you create a standard based on that other person's performance. You try, and fail. Then fail again. Again. And again... It becomes very apparent to you, that it's not as easy as it looks.   
Then begins the path towards envy, especially if there was a crowd that saw your new rival's performance and your failures. Those with admiration usually maintain a respect for the person and will probably choose a more positive reaction. Those in awe usually are overcome by the fear they initially felt. In both cases, the person begins to develop feelings of inadequacy if they continue to fail to meet the expectations they made based on someone else's performance. Admirers tend to internalize these feelings, while those in awe tend to externalize them. These trends aren't set in stone but do affect self image.   
**Developing a Negative Self Image**  
When we fail to meet the standards based on the expectations we made, it can lead to a strong negative self-image. We start to believe that we failed because we are innately not good enough instead of thinking maybe we set the bar a little to high for our current progress. This can lead to assumptions that we are not capable or deserving of success. This can affect our mental health and well being and lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and low self esteem. We may even begin to doubt our abilities and lose confidence in ourselves over time which further hinders our progress.   
The signs of a negative self image, is when you constantly say negative things and are critical about yourself even when the object of comparison isn't in your mind. You may see them in the day and go home and continue to have negative thoughts. Or maybe the negative thoughts stop, but as you wake up and prepare for the day they resurface because you dread the idea of being in an environment where you aren't good enough. You may even try to initially avoid those stimuli, but curiosity just gets the better of you. Or maybe you have friends that just can't stop talking about the progress the object of comparison has made.   
**Resentment/Envy**  
When your ego has been damaged by a negative self-image for too long you can start to build a lot of hate. First, hate for yourself for not being able to achieve what you wanted. Then hate for others for being able to achieve what you couldn't in a feeling called resentment. Once you start resenting people you look at them in a different lens. Suddenly every further example of progress or achievement they make starts to hurt you.   
Eventually you start to become or feel hostile to them because they have something you don't. This pattern of feeling hostile every time they succeed can turn into envy. Envy is one of the most dangerous sins and cause of unhappiness. It's when you have a such a strong desire of what someone else has that you will be tempted to take it, or at least destroy it. Have you ever heard of crabs in a bucket mentality? ""If I can't have it, no one can."" This is a signal that demonstrates the person has developed an covetous mindset and needs mental health guidance.   
**Loss of Focus/Negative Path**  
When we become envious of others, it can distract us from our own goals. Sometimes we may even enjoy this feeling of envy because it's easier than the challenges in front of us. In simple terms, it's much easier to tear down other people's ambitions and dreams rather than focus on chasing our own. At this stage of envy you may attempt or successfully sabotage another person's efforts. The goal is usually to get an emotional reaction out of them. To see them fall from grace or hoping to see other's lose respect from them or their abilities. Sabotage does not improve anyone or any situation and is a dangerous response.   
**Present Moment Disassociation**   
Once you get to the point where you actively attempt to sabotage another person, you will lose joy in the present moment. Meaning you will miss out on all the positive experiences and opportunities being offered to you. You may even start to lose gratitude and not appreciate what you have. It can cause you to lose relationships, status, and even all the materials that you worked hard to gather. Not to mention that it can cause you to become the black sheep whenever something goes wrong. This is not a reputation that you want because it can easily cause your already fragile mental state to deteriorate even worse. If you already internalize negative thoughts, you may become what people say you are just to avoid argument.   
**Reversing the Path**  
If you've already fallen into the trap of envy and have done something terrible because of it, it's okay. We all make mistakes, but you will have to deal with the consequences of your actions. To reverse the path, move backwards. Recognize that you attempted to sabotage or actively sabotaged someone else. You need to find a way to resolve the situation so that the damage is repaired. Once you've done that it's time to go back to focusing on your own goals so that you can start your own progress. Positive affirmations can help you break down the negative self image you've created for yourself. Afterwards, you can realize that you set unrealistic expectations and need to set ones that focus on your current ability level.   
**How to Escape Overcomparison**  
If you are someone who constantly compares themselves to others and you feel like a general failure, is time to realize that you have a problem. The first step is to cut off all triggers that cause you to over compare. Unfollow people outside of your current level and find people closer to where you are. If you are in conversations that constantly mention the progress or success of others, then simply remove yourself and use the time to go work on your own goals. Eventually you will escape the habit of comparison, and instead build habits of building your own progress.

I'm 25 male.
I've broken up with my gf(I've proposed to her , but shit went down..) 4 years ago, now she's married her colleague ( she probably cheated with him , because I had a suspicion and our friend told me that she was dancing and talking with that guy while we were together). From that moment I've lost not only my gf 
From our brake up i haven't had any relationships or hookups.
I've tried boxing , working on 2 jobs , getting second bachelor , but nothing really changing in myself.
I've even went to army , but got sent back 4 months later due to depression episodes.
Currently I'm laying in Malta , but i don't really get any joy or emotion's whatsoever. I really awkard, can't approach any women or make new friends. I don't know, i think I've burnt out as a personality. Work doesn't feels like anything, nor does status or purchases . Alcohol is making it worse , i just start thinking more.
Don't get me wrong , i don't wanna sit all alone or end it all , i just wanna be happy again and feel something.
Probably, it's pretty stupid that I'm writing this here , but docs or medication don't really help tbh , shit makes it even worse.

Here's an excerpt: 

*1)* **Mold your life around your top strengths**: I tell my friends all the time that a big predictor of wellbeing is using your top strengths every day at work. For example, my top strengths are creativity and bravery. So I feel especially happy and fulfilled when I‚Äôm coming up with crazy research ideas, trying them out, and getting them critiqued by brilliant scientists. Don‚Äôt know your strengths? Find out. It‚Äôs critical. Take the free survey and then try to design your life around your strengths. Otherwise, you leave a lot of your wellbeing to chance.

2) **Prioritize relationships**: Chris Peterson was a giant in positive psychology. He said that most studies in positive psychology boil down to one idea: *other people matter*. For example, getting raises is less likely to improve your wellbeing than forgiving an estranged relative. Our wellbeing expands when we prioritize relationships.

3) **Give thanks**: Bob Emmons is the editor of the Journal of Positive Psychology and a leader in gratitude research. He suggests that we carve out time in life to (a) practice gratitude as a solitary practice as well as (b) express gratitude to others. Various studies suggest that writing down 3‚Äì5 things each night that you are grateful for is a great habit, as well as taking the time to write a letter of gratitude and then read it out loud to someone in your life.

4) **Find out your primal world beliefs**: Primal world belief research is quite new, but it might be important. For example, one of the big correlations in the natural world is the correlation between surface temperature on Earth and distance from the equator. The correlation between the belief that the world is a good place and psychological wellbeing is about the same size. Take the free survey at myprimals.com, find out what your own primal world beliefs are, how they compare to the average American, and digest your personalized report.

5) **Decide what primal world beliefs you want to hold**: Someone in one of my studies once said that they could never see the world as an abundant place because they grew up poor. Others tell me that they can‚Äôt see the world as safe because they live in a high crime neighborhood. Most people tend to think their primal world beliefs reflect the objective truth of their own life or the world, yet both intuitions appear false. For example, on average, people who live in high crime areas don‚Äôt see the world as more dangerous, and poor people are about as likely as rich people to see the world as abundant. Further, an empirical study recently showed that, when the pandemic made the world more dangerous, the *belief* that the world is dangerous didn‚Äôt really change. This means that most of us likely hold the primal world beliefs we hold not *because* of what happens in our life or the world but *despite* it. If so, the world is not forcing primal world beliefs on you. We may have some choice in our beliefs about the world, and those choices may have big ramifications for our wellbeing.",Relaxed
1247,"I feel like everything that brings me joy in life will inevitably be ruined.  You know the concept of ""enshittification"" that Cory Doctorow talked about with websites and other services like that? It feels like that's happening all the time with everything - especially the things that bring me joy in the world. 

I'm a writer and I want to make a career out of it, but I don't know how when every possible publication is either on the verge of shutting down or about to turn into a meaningless content mill. I could be a professor somewhere, but I'll have to be an adjunct for years if I even get that far, because the entire world has been turned into a gig economy. The movie industry is in as precarious a place as it's ever been, especially movie theaters, which are one of my favorite places in the world. The internet has been shrunk to five sites that regurgitate content from one to the other. Everything's run by private equity firms that do nothing but suck the joy out f the world. AI could make things even worse, to say nothing of climate change. And I have no idea how any of this can be fixed.

I'm not in the mindset to sh right now, but I can imagine myself coming to that in the distant future. I have a girlfriend who I adore, but I don't want her to deal with all this shit, either. I don't know if I'm catastrophizing or if things are really that dire, but I just don't know what to do. I don't want this to be the rest of my life.",Relaxed

It's weird that I don't have to accomplish anything in life to enjoy living.  
For example i don't have to like my voice to enjoy singing and that's weird.

I always *think* about hobbies. And I can get excited for them in my brain. But irl I'll do something for 15-30 minutes then feel stressed or bored and I can't anymore. I just stress out about all the ""work"" it takes to finish a project, or I'll be unable to focus at all. 

I get no enjoyment out of the things that used to make me happy. I feel so dull. 

I just want to do art, or read, or literally anything productive at all. I feel so useless. I get nothing out of life.

1250,"I feel no joy in pretty much anything in life - job, hobbies, friends etc. What can I do?  From the outside, I look like a typical city-dwelling millennial women. I have a good job, a long-term solid relationship, good friends, am healthy, and look after myself. My friends and family believe I have the best lifestyle and love my life.   


However, behind that veneer, I barely feel joy at anything and feel like I'm constantly just ""holding on"". Only my boyfriend really knows the extent of how I feel as we live together.   


1. I hate my job. It pays well, isn't that stressful, but is excruciatingly dull. I feel its ripping away some of my best years of my twenties. It's not really going anywhere 
2. I've tried new hobbies - like running, but just don't care. They become a drag and just add to the load that I feel I'm carrying around with me. 
3. I live in a modern city and feel I have this constant pressure for ""more"". A balance of somehow saving money, having nice things, doing nice things, spending time with friends, having a clean house etc etc. It's a combination that just feels like a perpetual cycle downwards. 

I just feel stuck. I have basically nothing I enjoy doing, and don't know what the next step is. It's a darkness of simply not caring about anything - which leads to low energy, enthusiasm and basically a direction of just doing nothing all day.

I'm 18 now and I just realised that nothing I know of makes me happy in either way. Everything is meh. I've been told it might be drepression but I don't feel sad or anything I just am. Its very annoying because I feel like I'm cruising through life missing out on everything because it all feels so hollow and boring to me.

From what I have learned through my life and experiences ""happy"" is just the absence of depression. You probably don't see things the same way as I do so keep that in mind. I'm a 23 year old fella who has dealt with my fair share of stuff, after trying to end my life 3 times. 

Once trying to OD by taking somewhere between 70-80 2mg xanax bars and planing to try to drink a quart of rum to get that CNS depression down to a coma state, what ended up happening was I passed out before I could take more then 2 shots and ended up just blacking out for what I guess to be 2-3 weeks. Sometime during the blackout I had a few pieces of memory and I remember a shady person I was hanging around sexually assaulted me and took a knife and sliced my genitals just enough to leave a big scar. After dealing with that for about a year I decided to go to the cops and try to have him charged, they got back to me after I had a interview and said there was no evidence they could use to make a case and the person had moved out of their jurisdiction by then 

My gf at the time broke up with me just about the same time so I thought to myself ""It's been a short life but I guess its time to see what lays in wait after death"". I moved in with my mom and step dad cus I had no where else to go at the time. Both of them where abusive as hell to me and my younger brother but they at least went a little softer on my sisters. I remember my stepdad used to keep a small wooden 2 x 4 plank board in the car and would reach back while driving and just start swinging it wildly while still looking at the road if me or my brother where ""too loud"" or if we had attitude when he asked us any question,""Maybe is the wrong answer"" still rings in my head, he would get mad if you said yes or no in the wrong tone, there was just no way to get out of talking to him without at least getting something thrown across the room at you. 

So living with them was less then ideal so after only a few days of staying there I had enough so I took his shotgun when no one was home and found that I couldn't reach the trigger while having it pointed at my head so I came up with a test of the universe I thought to myself ""I'm going to grab a twig and put it on the trigger and use my feet on either side of it to press down while having it pointed at my forehead"" since you are reading this you can guess that the stick broke and didnt press the trigger down enough to fire it off. At the time all this stuff was kept to myself and I didn't tell anyone about what was going on and I wasn't in a good mindset and was abusing all manners of substances, I have taken more recreational drugs then you can probably name TBH. 

After losing my job due to the company getting sold to someone different shortley after I just totally gave up again and got in my car and drove down a empty road and got it going as fast as I could the insurance said the car was going 150 km/h in a 60 zone and turned the wheel as hard left as I could, managed to hit the top of a telephone line and got thrown out of the car and broke 12 bones, ruptured my spleen and left kidney and had to have metal rods and screws put into my spine because I crushed the bottom 3 discs. After waking up from a coma I got sent to the psych ward for a week.

 I'm in pain all the time and just stay in my room but I got some medication to help with my mental problems. But the only time I feel ""happy"" is when I am asleep. The key to happiness isn't being happy its to fill your life with unimportant tasks that divert your attention like a hobby, all the things I used to enjoy like art, nature and music I find little to no joy in anymore. What I do to pass the time is just watch tv and play video games which I dont really enjoy but it makes the clock move faster then staring at the wall. If you find a reliable way to be distracted from your problems for breif moments try to enjoy it for as long as you can. Keep in mind that this is all written by someone who is mentally ill and not advice for your own problems which probalay differ somewhat from mine",Relaxed

1282,"How to simplify life and multiply the joy?  Hello Mental Health Community,

I am Simi Hanspal, A Trained mental health counselor. Today I have a story to tell you all about [How to simplify life and multiply the joy](https://www.themindspace.in/post/simplify-life-to-multiply-joy), **Hope You All Like It.**

 I was sitting in the park after a long walk by myself to take a breather. I saw the kids from the neighborhood playing football, small girls on the swing, others cycling their tricycle and the giggling and laughter filled the air. The park, by itself, offers solace in its own way ‚Äì the perfectly manicured grass, the huge oak tree housing peacocks, and the seasonal winter flowers. I sipped water from my bottle and took all this in, At that moment I realized this was one of the most peaceful, beautiful moments in my life and it didn‚Äôt even cost a thing. It triggered a spate of emotions in me as I started reminiscing other such moments when I felt so much joy inside my heart and all it took was for me to LOOK. 

### I have made a list of things to do this year to simplify my life and be really happy:

* I won‚Äôt waste time being negative ‚Äì I will resist the urge to gossip, regret and feel guilty about things that don‚Äôt work for me
* I want to be more frugal ‚Äì in terms of clothes, shoes, and other frivolities I have indulged in mindlessly
* I need to learn to say No more often and declutter my mental space
* I want to spend less time on social media ‚Äì the hours that it can eat up with nothing to show has been one of my vices
* Make a list of priorities in my life and eliminate the extra clutter that is simply taking up too much space in my head
* Cutting the toxic people out of my life ‚Äì we all have people in our lives who complain about things that aren‚Äôt working for them endlessly. It's time to set healthy boundaries for them to not pull me into their negativity

1283,Angst and Joy  I go through periods where the darkness and doom am anxiety are so intense I would welcome an end but would not create one for myself.

I don‚Äôt know why but I felt strongly that I needed to tell them that. I would want them to know that I was finally free from the angst and that I had been saved from more years of the same.

1285,"How do you find joy in being alone as an extrovert?  tl;dr: moved across the country twice in the last year, I have no friends or family where I‚Äôm living. But as an extrovert this is really tough, so how can I get some joy being alone ? 

Just to give some back story, when I finished university I got a job in my field of studies. However this career has required me to move twice within the last year both being very large distances (over 3,000Km each move). 

Just to put it in perspective within the last year I‚Äôve had to move from Boston to LA, then LA to Pittsburgh within the last year. 

Because of these moves I actually haven‚Äôt had time to build a friend group in these new areas (in addition to 2021 issues in general). 

This has been pretty hard to deal with because I would classify myself as an extrovert, when I was in my home city I would always be hanging out with my mates‚Ä¶. I was rarely ever alone. Until now. 

Lately I‚Äôve been finding myself really struggling with just daily tasks and trying to find enjoyment in everyday. I try to stay in touch with all my friends through Xbox, FaceTime and stuff but it‚Äôs not the same. 

So I‚Äôm just wondering how do you find enjoyment in being alone ? Im hoping with 2022 things open up more and I can get involved in stuff in my city to put myself out there again but until that happens I don‚Äôt really know what to do.",Relaxed
1286,"Pathological joy?  I have this trait. I can walk in the street, funny things start getting inside my head and I start smiling. When someone crosses by, I start to think that would be funny if I would start smiling, and therefore I start smiling. I think some people got offended, even though there was nothing about.

It's as if I have to fake joy or sadness, by doing what I  think people would expect.

I can see my friends smiling and laughing so I smile and laugh with them but it doesn't feel real to me.

And now, I laugh. I laugh so much that I'm left breathless, my tummy aching. I laugh and cry. Cry tears of joy. Every time I laugh, I end up crying from the joy.  Which was very unusual even before after all the shit hit the fan. I would cry only when I was laughing way too much.

But now. Now it's every time I laugh. As if my own body is saying""there you are! Welcome back!"" And I feel so utterly blessed.

1291,"I've lost my joy for life, and I'm scared of myself  I don't know what is wrong with me. I'm so sick of everything. Things that should make me happy don't. I'm in college and I have a very small group of friends. I can't seem to make any more. When I am with people, I am there but not there. It's like I'm living in a haze. 

I think I saw my late grandfather the other day. I know it makes me sound crazy, but I really do. I keep finding pennies, always heads side up. I found one, picked it up. As I turned, I saw a figure in the doorway. It looked like his stature. I found an old voicemail from the day he died a few days later. It was my dad talking about how he was getting worse and that I needed to watch my brother. 

I didn't get to speak to him before I died. I was too stupid and lazy to take an opportunity to say anything to him. He had surgery. I wasn't allowed to see him, and I didn't even call or text because I thought he'd be fine. He was supposed to be home soon and I was touring colleges- it's all excuses but I really didn't know it was going to be bad. And when he died and he probably didn't even know I cared. And it's all my fault. Even my mother thinks so. I fucked up real bad, and I can't fix it. And I feel like I'm doing it over and over again. Being stupid and lazy and wasting time until I have nothing and that makes me awful and worthless. But I don't know how to stop. Or maybe I do and I'm too worthless to do it. I don't know.

I'm sleepwalking through life. I'm never present. I can't will myself to speak in class. I can't will myself to make friends. I can't will myself to do anything right. 

I've been cutting myself again. I used to do it when I was a little girl. About 12-13 years old. (I'm 19 now). It's even a real cut. I can't even do that right lmao. I use an eyebrow razor so It's more of a scratch than a slice.

1292,"I genuinely do not understand how someone can immediately burst into tears of emotion when seeing the person they miss most. Missing them, sure. But bursting into tears of joy that fast?

1293,"Nothing brings me joy anymore  I don't really use this account, but I just need to vent and I don't want to talk to my family about this. It's not that I don't trust them, It's just that I don't want to burden them with my existence.

I don't want to wake up anymore. I've been struggling with a lot of negative emotions since I was about 12, so 6 years now. My home life was fine as a child, my parents argued a lot but it never got physical and they still loved each other.  We never really had enough money to buy nice things or pay rent for that matter so we moved often, but I didn't mind. One day though my father didn't come back from work and my siblings and I didn't understand why. We found out that he had a major accident at work where he fell 3 stories off a ladder onto a pile of jagged rubble. Needless to say, he was put on a lot of pain medication.

Life moved on though; he got better, we moved, everything was normal. Until one day he didn't come home again. This time my mom knew why though and wouldn't tell us. Turns out he was arrested for theft. He pleads guilty in court because if he fought the case he knew he would lose and get an extended sentence. So my father is gone from my life at the most crucial time for a young man. This is when my mental health took a decline.

I won't bother explaining what else happened during the time unless someone asks me, but I do need to explain something; my father hadn't gotten better after the fall, he got worse. He became addicted to pain killers and my mother found out. Instead of helping him, she abused this. Sending my father to stores to steal high value electronics, while he was high on pain killers, like T.V.'s or computers and sell them to the pawn shop near our house. Obviously he still loved my mother and didn't want her to take the fall so he confessed to being the only one involved.

During that time the moving, unstable relationships my mother was in, and having to look after my siblings that weren't sent to live with relatives really took a toll on me. I had to be the man of the house, the emotionally stable one, and get good enough grades to ensure I would make it into a good school to secure a well paying job to save my siblings from the situation we lived in. But in 2016, my mom passed away. She did everything she could for us but it wasn't easy for her considering that I found out she was an alcoholic. I guess that explains what she did to my father and why he covered for her. She had her own demons she was fighting through. Anyway, after her brother gave her laced cocaine, she fell asleep and never woke up.

After that my siblings and I moved in with my grandma, uprooting our lives again. To shorten things from this point up until now, my father is out of jail and owns a successful business. My siblings are doing well in school, aside from the online classes, and we live in a decent house. The thing is, I no longer have any goals. No motivation. For years I was fueled by rage and spite, my desire to succeed in a world that said I couldn't. Now that I have everything I need I have no joy for the struggle. I'm burnt out from years of bottling up my emotions and ignoring the hardships I endured. All I feel now is the burning desire to get revenge against the man who got my mother addicted to cocaine, to the man that killed her, and at the world for letting any of this happen in the first place. 

Every day I feel like I'm getting closer to lashing out on the world and I'm afraid of what I'll do if that ever happens. I'm known to bigger and bigger outbursts the longer I harbor resentment. Imagine what could happen if I let the resentment I've been bottling up for 6 years could do? I shudder to think about it.",Relaxed
1294,"I just can't find joy anymore  For example, I've been watching Brooklyn 99 and I know I find it funny and I really like watching it but my reaction to the comedy is just nothing. I'm constantly flat and watching Brooklyn 99 has made me realise this. I don't laugh, I just stare at the TV watching it. I probably look really weird if someone could see me. 

It's the same with YouTube videos that I've watched many times in the past and I always found them hilarious, I rewatch them to have a laugh and because I love them but now I'm just not getting that feeling anymore. I constantly watch nerdcubed (you should check him out if you don't know him) I know I love him and his content but even this doesn't bring me joy anymore. His videos saved my life in my darkest times and when I finally met him 2 weeks ago I told him how much he's helped me, I was so happy that I met him but it still didn't bring me joy. 

I don't know how else to explain it besides ""flat"". 

I keep making really dark jokes at work about wanting to die and I'm not usually like that. Deep down inside I know I want to die but I don't want to commit suicide and I'm just pushing the fact I want to die onto my colleagues and friends in the form of dark humour and I don't want to do that but for some reason I can't help it. 

I feel bad for my colleagues having to suffer from me constantly joking around saying I want to die then asking if that joke was too dark. 

I can't find happiness in anything anymore. I have my dream job with amazing colleagues that I'm proud to call my family but even my job doesn't make me happy. 

I'm just constantly numb to things that should make me hapoy and I'm miserable. 

I think it's my antidepressants causing this since they've upped my dose a few months ago but every time I talk to my doctor's they're very reluctant to change them. I'm on the highest dose of mirtazapine they can give me. 

I just don't know what to do. I do what makes me happy but I literally can't feel happiness anymore. I think I'll try to get another doctors appointment this week to talk to them because I don't know what to do and I don't want to be like this, it's affecting my work quality and also affecting my relationships with my colleagues. 

I don't know, I feel like I needed to vent but I'm also just so emotionally ""lost"".",Relaxed

I was super happy when I moved to my first apartment where Im by myself in september. No pesky housemates, full freedom, pure bliss! And I am so happy in a new relationship that I have just started in December. But somehow, on weekdays when Im not with my boyfriend, I find myself going stir crazy and wanting to cry. 
I got obssessive-compulsive over a water stain on my hardwood floor and I ended up destroying the floor trying to apply 1000 solutions all because I was anxious to tell my landlady who is a super scary and agressive person. When she handed over the apartment to me, it was squeaky clean, brand new and spotless. She went through every small corner of the apartment with me and complained about every small thing the previous tenant did.
Now every small scratch I see, every stain, annoys me and makes me feel sad. 
I completely lost the joy in my new place. I even stopped cooking which is something I enjoyed doing here. although its small, its a lovely newly remodeled place and I really want to be excited and happy to be here again...

But now, I just use them to keep my brain from dwelling on the more depressing stuff, like how some of my old hobbies became a last ditch effort to avoid being swallowed by obscurity, or how I can't ever talk about how I really feel with my friends, because I don't want to bring down the mood, etc. Even towards the end of hanging out with my friends, I feel worse than at the start of when we were hanging out.

end of 2019 I had a fun job. We'd just been married and bought a house, and I had done some traveling for work. At the time I remember feeling wrapped up in my own issues (job wasn't perfect, dysfunctional parents still popped up to torment me) but looking back on it I'd give anything to return to that.

I got offered a new job that on paper looked better. I decided to take it, with much sadness. It was a sad time as me and many of my friends quit and moved away. Literally on Decemeber 31st while having a new years party I began having some funny symptoms - I ended up sick with Covid Classic (tm) for months. 

New job did NOT pan out. I quit after 8 months after developing chronic health issues from the work environment and possibly long covid. The new job was much more restrictive and much lonlier and repetitive than my last job. I would come home from work and sit and stare at the wall for the entire evening before dragging myself into work. I didn't realize it soon enough but I was becoming deeply traumatized by it.

That was in Aug 2020. After quitting that job I began applying to new ones, but every one of them turned me down. I've been jobless (my husband has been supporting us all right, but I can't do this forever). Unfortunately it just hasn't been going well, and I don't even want to work in my field any more. I have no idea what to do, and the longer I don't work the harder it feels to return to working. I don't see anyone. I don't go anywhere. I don't want to go through the suffering of having covid again. I feel like a horrible deadbeat. I thought if I had all the time I needed I'd get into my hobbies... but that hasn't happened either. I can't seem to get myself to work on anything. Most days now I just feel nothing. All night I haven't been able to get myself to do anything. I do my best to keep the house clean and that's all I have in me. All the things I used to do for fun - thrift shop, walk around a store, see friends, maybe visit an art club or take art classes - all squashed for covid. Travel - all squashed for covid. Job interview? The ones I've been on have been maskless and left me scared. Any time I  do push the rules and go out I wonder if I've caught it. We never got to go on our honeymoon. 

Meanwhile the weather in my part of the world has changed (we used to get snow in the winter, now it's just creepily warm or dangerously cold but no snow), watching some of my favorite places I've visited in the past burn down, watching prices keep going up, politics getting worse.

Moving out seems like my only chance  For context, I‚Äôm 20, and have spent most of my life without any ambitions and convinced I prefer to be alone. But after I turned 20, I created a life for myself in London in my university. I‚Äôm in third year, and it took me a year and a half at uni to feel comfortable in this life, and a further few months to actually start enjoying my life.
But, just as I‚Äôm enjoying it, I‚Äôm aware that this is all contingent on the very specific circumstances of me living with my best friends, living close to other best friends, and having the structure of uni, and the commutability of london. This has become really apparent to me now that I‚Äôm back home for the month for Christmas.
In my home town, I have no friends, and so my life feels completely empty, and it has done despite everything I‚Äôve tried to do to fix it.

This year has proven to me that I can be more than the worst version of myself, but I don‚Äôt think I can be the best version of me if I continue to live in my town. So, even though I am only 20, I am considering starting anew in a new city (not london, too expensive). As I have nothing here, I‚Äôd only have my family + the familiar setting to leave behind.

I didn't know what to do. From a holistic view, everything seemed normal and good. But the reality was totally different. The society was too fast paced. I had to be another person to match up to speed with the rest of them. Somewhere I lost myself there and that unhappiness kicked in because of which I'd cry and cry to my mom every other day. She'd console me but nothing helped. I'd develop inner strength most times and keep moving ahead.
Fast forwarding a bit.
In Jan this year, I did a meditation/yoga course as one of my friends recommended. I'd heard about it but wasn't sure if I'd be interested (because I thought meditation was so boring and not for me). I have been practicing that 21 minute meditation since then. Trust me, my life has taken a different turn. I was just thinking, what was it, that was messing my life so much before. And the answer is - my own mind. I was giving the control of my life to my mind. Now I consciously remind myself that it's a brief life and it's all upto me to make it my best one. However the external situations are, I constantly try telling myself that I need to be happy. I can hands down say, that the meditation has helped me a lot and I look forward to spreading this happiness pill across.",Relaxed

Nothing works for me anymore, video games used to do it but they don‚Äôt anymore. I‚Äôve tried online dating only to see how much of a shitty person I am in those kinds of relationships. I have friends, but it seems like it‚Äôs only online now, my real life friends have either moved on with their lives or have abandoned me and my family is a joke, they all believe mental illness to be fake and something I can just get over.

I have been comparing my ""closeness"" to my friends with that of, say, how close another friend of mine is to her friends (e.g ""she has more best friends"" ""she is closer to her friends"" ""I wish I had as many girlfriends as her"" ""I wish people liked me as much"" etc). 

If any of my friends arrange to meet up without me the blood drains from my face and I feel utterly ashamed, left out, hated. 

A friend of mine received a text recently from another friend of ours and all I could think was ""why did she think to text her instead of me?"" ""Does this mean she likes her more?"". 

It's ridiculous because other people are entitled to see and text whoever they wish. 

These constant negative thoughts and comparisons are impacting my life to the point that I can barely function. 

I have also had an old childhood friend, whom I haven't spoken to in a number of years, make regular appearances in my dreams and find I'm comparing myself to her ""friends"" situation also (""she has more friends than me"") and I am finding it hard to forgive myself for us not being friends anymore (a mistake I made when I was 18 - this is now nearly 10 years later).

1310,"I don‚Äôt see how I can keep living life with no motivation/joy  I‚Äôve been to multiple therapists/psychiatrists. Paired with my own research and introspection, I feel like I have a decent understanding of what drives my feelings and actions. I just got out of my first session with yet another therapist... paying $175 just to be told ‚Äúyou‚Äôre dealing with a lot and I‚Äôm not sure what you expect me to tell you.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm so tired down to my soul. In the past year I‚Äôve lost everything I spent my life building, and I have no motivation to start building a new life. Nothing excites me. I have nothing to look forward to. 

My son is the only thing keeping me going, and I only get to see him half the time (and when he‚Äôs at his moms, he doesn‚Äôt reach out to me at all). 

My ex pops up a couple times a week just to try to make me feel like crap (for example, calling me poor after demanding I help her with taxes/her credit score). 

I work a job I hate, doing more work while making 30-50% less than all others in my department (I got a pay cut coinciding with my divorce because they KNEW I couldn‚Äôt quit without jeopardizing my custody battle). My work phone starts going off around 3am from our Europe offices, and slows down around 8pm. 

I sometimes go days without human interaction because I never learned how to initiate or maintain relationships. It‚Äôs not for lack of effort... I reach out to people, strike up conversations at bars/events. I have no problems attracting women, but get ghosted when I try to keep things platonic. I need friends, not a girlfriend or meaningless sex. Nobody ever reaches out to check on me. 

I have nothing more than brief, passing interest in any topic. I‚Äôll spend hundreds of dollars and hours getting into something I kinda like... and within a few weeks it feels like a chore to give it any attention. 

Objectively speaking, I should be on top of the world. I‚Äôm intelligent (finished high school with an Associates Degree, Mensa member, etc), competent enough to converse on a huge variety of topics, reasonably attractive, crazy work ethic despite feeling there‚Äôs no point, attentive/respectful/polite in all my interactions. But it is seriously like every person in my personal and professional life see this and try to take as much as they can without giving anything in return. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. No matter what I change or try, things stay the same. I‚Äôm not suicidal, because I could never abandon my son. But I just don‚Äôt see how/why I‚Äôd deal with this for another 40+ years.",Relaxed
1311,"I can't find happiness in what used to give me joy, what can I do about this?  I live in the UK and lately finished university.

Over the last few years (started in about 2019) I just can't seem to be as happy as I was when I was younger. 

To give some info about me, I'm a nerd I love tech, video games, dungeons & dragons, and everything else like that. Over the course of university, I tried to find myself and what I want from life and came to the conclusion that all I want is to enjoy life and be happy. No matter what if I enjoy it I should do it life is too short to not spend every possible moment having fun but keeping in mind everything that allows having fun e.g. job/education. I do have a job and my own apartment, and overall my life is going fine.

Lately, I have been having trouble enjoying life, almost everything feels hollow and empty. Video games are the best example. As a kid, I could play a game for a whole day letting hours fly by while having the time of my life. Now even when I try a new game I normally play it for an hour or two and I am having fun else I wouldn't be doing it but after the time has passed this feeling of emptiness that can be best summarized as an 'emotional sigh' and I just don't want to play anymore and looking back on that hour it feels less fun in retrospective than when I was playing. The same thing happens with shows I would watch, and other hobbies I would enjoy.

Don't get me wrong this isn't the case all the time there are the odd game or show or whatever that I play/watch/do and It captures that childhood moment of time flying by while you just have fun and when you look at the clock its already midnight, but these have become rarer as time has passed.

I still try new things like I normally would, so I am not someone who just does the same thing every day. It's just that when I do find things I enjoy I try to make them a regular hobby.

I don't really know what to do I just want to enjoy my life as I used to when all you want from life is to enjoy it in any way you can, but just can't it is so frustrating to me.

I don't like myself...my appearance, how I act at work and at home. My work is slipping, I've really let myself go physically the past year, I do nothing but spew sarcasm, and I never feel or appear happy about anything.

Friends - in hopes that board games or social times would cheer me up.

Family - Just to talk or visit

Internet - Such as here, to vent and hope that I'm not alone.

I‚Äôd say it feels like I‚Äôm living automatically, working, studying, and sleeping, but what used to make me happy and enjoy my time no longer hit the same. 

I know something ain‚Äôt right. Something is off indeed. At the same time, it also feels like you do not belong to any place, to any environment, whether it‚Äôs friends, jobs, studies, or fields. You just keep moving forward without any major reason at all, like a robot, just because it‚Äôs just what you‚Äôve always been doing since you are a child.

I‚Äôd be lying if I told you I don‚Äôt really care since I‚Äôm writing it here, so maybe someone might relate to it, or a piece of advice would be given in the future. Where are the colours that compounded my world when I was younger? Why can‚Äôt I love someone else and I can‚Äôt feel being loved by someone? Even among people you know, you feel lonely and off-put. 

Nowadays, I have no clue at all if I‚Äôm who I really am, or if I‚Äôve been masking it all for so long that I became someone else. My memory is flawed, and my senses of carefulness are either numb or were gotten away from me.

If life has given people a compass to have some guidance, mine came out broken. It has been so long since I‚Äôve hung out with friends, since I truly loved someone and felt loved, since I felt‚Ä¶ joy? Unfortunately (who knows) I‚Äôve been getting too comfortable with my discomfort, and here I am. Was I born ‚Äúwrongly‚Äù? Is my brain missing a wire? Is there anything wrong with me? Even though I can label someone ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, I‚Äôd give my arm for being a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person as society labels them.

I‚Äôve reached so many things, things that people wholeheartedly consider incredible and amazing only to feel ‚ÄúYeah, cool.

I don‚Äôt flex or brag over what I‚Äôve achieved, but what usually would feel amazing and successfully done for most people it‚Äôs just ‚Äúok, whatever‚Äù for me.

Sorry for venting, but I had to take this off my chest. I just want to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again, fellow friends. It seems I‚Äôm complaining too much, so I better shut off myself for a while. That‚Äôs all. Stay safe, and if you made up to here, thank you!",Relaxed

1322,"I feel like nothing really brings me joy anymore.  I actually just wrote this down just for myself, because I needed to vent. But I decided to share my thoughts because maybe some people here feel the same way or have something to say about it. It's probably really messy and doesn't make any sense and I'm sorry about that. It's nothing of much importance, just some random thoughts that bothered me. 



Don't get me wrong, I'm very excited when I THINK about doing something I love. 
I imagine it in my head beforehand and I always tell myself that no matter how things turn out, at least I did something that I love to do. 
Drawing a picture, baking a cake, heck, even just going outside to walk around a bit. These are things that I loved to do once so of course when I think about them I get a warm feeling and I tell myself ""try it again. It's gonna bring you joy."" 

But I've noticed that, for some time now, these hobbies that I've used to do with so much passion and joy, they just leave me with a blank and unsatisfied feeling. 
After hours of hard work I'm not even proud of myself anymore. I just feel sad. Sad that it didn't turn out how I imagined it to be and sad about the fact that I absolutely wasn't having fun while doing it.

I know that things almost never turn out how you imagine them to be, ESPECIALLY with art and all that. 
And I know that every step I take, no matter how small it is, will lead me to a goal. I know that with everything I do, I will get better at it, even if I can't see it at first. 

But I'm not sure if my hobbies should stress me this much. 
I hate that I always act like a child whenever something doesn't go the way I imagined it to. I tend to get really really sad and annoyed to the point where I start pushing away the people that I love. 
It's ridiculous. Such an insignificant thing to be upset about, right? 
But I can't stop it and I can't just turn it off. Most of the time I just need to sleep it off, and when I wake up the next day I always think to myself ""that was such an irrelevant thing to make such a drama about."" But then the cycle just repeats itself. 

Most people would probably try something new, and I guess that's a healthy thing to do. But I'm so afraid of doing new stuff because I know that naturally I won't be good at them and my stupid mind thinks that that's the worst crime I could ever commit. 
I'm good at art. I love to read and to bake. I love spending time with my friends.
I feel like these are the things that define me and I don't just wanna give them up. 
But if they're only making me sad, I just don't know what to do. 
I feel like everything that once defined me as a person is just slowly getting ripped away from me as I get older and the only thing that's gonna be left is just a sad and empty shadow of the person that I once used to be. I know this sounds absolutely edgy. But I don't know how else to describe it. I hate this.

I'm not exactly sure what caused me to get worse overtime, I know part of it is puberty but I also feel like I may have done something different to cause all this overthinking and anxiety, and depression and being weak, lack of joy too. It's serious  It started out as me being a 10 year old boy who was always making crafts out of paper, I was really creative and had a good imagination. I would be making box forts and blanket forts. I was outside most of the time making stick forts and catching bugs, frogs, and lizards. I wasn't on social media that often, because most of the time I was outside. The times when I was on social media, it was very exciting and fun. When I layed down and had the fan on it was very relaxing and I felt peace and happiness. I would have sleepovers with my cousin and there was a top bed with a trundle bed underneath, there was a toy bin with a bunch of toys and there was toys on top of the bed, and I would always be outside playing with toys and making videos of them with my cousin. Whenever my cousin's mom offered to go on a nature walk, I felt this feeling of peace and happiness. Now we are gonna talk about what changed after this all, when I was 11 I started watching more YouTube videos, first it started with street fights, then it was watching ABC news, and it was all interesting and fun at first but it got boring, it started to make me feel weaker, more anxious, more depressed, no joy, and no excitement in life all that joy I used to have was gone and I am looking for an answer to feel like it again. Like what could I have done to weaken myself or worsen myself or lost the joy I used to have, I know part of it is puberty but what if I started doing things that weakened myself?

1333,"Comparison is the thief of joy - don't miss out on your life worrying about what other people have  Everyone compares themselves to others to some extent but when it plays on our thoughts frequently this can really impact on our wellbeing. The evidence on this has been around since the 1950s - people have always used their relative position against other people as a way of evaluating themselves. Its probably a natural part of the human experience, but problems arise when we‚Äôre constantly aware of what other people have and what we don‚Äôt have, leaving us dissatisfied with our lives.

The habits of being competitive and comparing ourselves may have built up over generations, so don‚Äôt beat yourself up for feeling this way. There isn‚Äôt a quick fix to it but there are a few things can help, the first being training your awareness. A little bit of practice every day makes a huge difference and we can use that training to be aware in the moment when that competitive energy is rising. In that moment, shining our awareness and giving that feeling our kindness while we breathe stops us from being swept away and breaks the link between feeling and acting.

The second way is to be grateful for what you have - keeping a log of three things every day of you‚Äôre grateful for is a great way to do this. These can be big things like your health, small things like your breakfast or neutral things like the feeling of your feet on the ground as you walk. Taking joy in the world around you is the formula for a happy life.

The last way is spending less time on the things that drive our competitive energy. That might be social media, certain TV programmes or it might be worth rethinking what you want from your career. If the alternative to eternally striving for success is a small, ordinary, happy life - whats wrong with that?

Now all I want to tell her is why the fuck did she save me just to put me in the same situation again. If I'd just gotten it over and done with well I wouldn't have had to fucking deal with all this shit. I tell people life is good and lie about how I feel because that's how I want to feel I just want to be okay and right as I wrote that I've just had my first real cry since last year. I just wish I was okay... I guess that's my trigger phrase because I know deep down I'll never be okay and this blur that people say is my life will end soon and I'll regret not stopping around for it to get better but also be grateful that if it doesn't get better I won't have to experience it get worse. I don't know what I want from this post. I kinda wish I had a friend that understood that sometimes I'll go for days never responding to know when to leave me be and when to come down and support me... I guess what I'm saying is that I want my fucking ex back because she knew me like nobody else and although she ruined me she was the cure. And I hate to say this but nobody can fill the void she left because she was everything to me I was an idiot for putting all my eggs in one basket but I was gonna marry her she was my support network she was my best friend she was the highlight of my day and now she's gone and even after almost a year I haven't bounced back and every girl I've been with I've fucked over because I tried so hard to be okay for them but I just couldn't open up to them... I can't let anyone close because I'm scared of getting hurt or hurting them even when I don't realise that's my problem. ",Relaxed

In essence, I'm stuck really badly wanting to do something, but I know for a fact, the moment I really get into it and ""release"" that energy to pour into an actual project, I'm going to completely lose all joy and interest, like a switch that's been flicked. It's not unlike right between being extremely hungry and about to make food. It's very similar in the general experience; when I'm starting to get hungry (just a while before I start fantasizing about food) I feel amazing, just pure dopamine fest. I look forward to eating but as soon as I do the feeling is gone. I wish I could hold onto that feeling between the two, but it's such a small time frame. I can't do anything about it either. If I don't eat, I know I'll start feeling shaky and worse after a while, but if I do, I'll feel bad also. I just can't win.

The same applies to the feeling I'm talking about. I'll have a lot of ideas for a story, and the thought of making it reality excites me as much as thinking about food does when I'm getting really hungry. But the moment I let it out of my head, regardless of the quality or accuracy to my mental image, it's like the fire of passion is blown out in an instant. I have a histoy of getting obsessed with things and after a while like gum that's been chewed on for too long, it'll lose its charm completely. I'm not talking about shifting to a casual interest, I mean I completely stop caring and it invokes nothing within me anymore. I can't stand it. There has been something I've managed to stay interested in for a long time by limiting my consumption of its media, I'll take breaks in intervals but I have to come back every now and then or I'll also lose interest and wonder why I was interested in the first place. It's very hard to maintain. And it's one of the few things that make life endurable to me, and incidentally it's also what this is about. A project, a story I have in mind to write about it, but my greatest fear is I will kill my one joy by releasing it from my headspace. It's like I have hands made of knives and a dog that I love but no matter how strong the feeling I can't touch it, because I've already killed so many things in the past, I want this one to be around, but it will always feel like there is a distance I can't reach, I can't obtain the one thing I long for, winning and failing are in the same spot and doing nothing doesn't feel like the solution either.",Relaxed

In the ever-evolving landscape of mental health awareness and care, Joy Spring Mental Health has emerged as a beacon of hope and support for individuals grappling with a wide range of mental health challenges. This article sheds light on the significance of Joy Spring Mental Health in promoting overall well-being, particularly in the context of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), ADHD symptoms in women, and maternal mental health. Let's delve into the various facets of Joy Spring Mental Health and how it is making a positive impact on lives.  
  
Understanding Spring Mental Health  
Joy Spring Mental Health is not just a mental health clinic; it's a philosophy centered on the belief that spring-like rejuvenation can be experienced in one's mental state, much like the changing seasons. Spring represents renewal, growth, and a fresh start. Similarly, Joy Spring Mental Health strives to help individuals rejuvenate their mental well-being, fostering growth, and supporting them in starting anew.  
  
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Joy Spring Mental Health  
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a [spring mental health](https://joyspringmentalhealth.com/) condition characterized by intrusive and repetitive thoughts (obsessions) and compulsive behaviors or mental rituals. It can be an overwhelming condition, affecting various aspects of an individual's life. Joy Spring Mental Health takes a comprehensive and compassionate approach to help individuals struggling with OCD.  
  
One of the key pillars of Joy Spring's approach to OCD is personalized treatment plans. No two individuals with OCD are the same, and Joy Spring recognizes this. Their team of experienced mental health professionals works closely with patients to understand their unique experiences and tailor treatment accordingly. This approach increases the effectiveness of therapy and the chances of long-term recovery.  
  
Furthermore, Joy Spring Mental Health employs evidence-based therapies such as Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) to address OCD. These therapies are known to be highly effective in helping individuals manage their obsessions and compulsions. With the guidance of skilled therapists, patients gradually confront their fears and anxieties in a controlled manner, leading to reduced OCD symptoms and improved overall well-being.",Relaxed

I just feel numb and empty, and that might be a form of sadness tbf. but every time I see something like ‚Äûwhen someone jokes about the worst point in my life but I just cried myself to sleep every night‚Äú (in context of depression or depressive episodes) I literally question whether I have another kind of depressive disorder or something like that. or is it just how I am? never was a big feeler. lack of empathy towards others and myself, barely gaf about what happens to me, never did. but that‚Äòs something else bc that is just lack of self love.

1353,"I systematically eliminated everything in my life that I ever found joy from; but I'm trying to get it all back.  Hi everyone!

As the title says, I did indeed eliminate everything from my life that brought me joy. Okay, so this is a long story, but I will try to condense it a bit. I have always been a very driven person, at least according to other people. So driven that I started eliminating the things I loved from my life to become more productive. This desire to eliminate the things I loved grew and grew and grew; before I had even realized what I was truly doing to myself, it was too late. Everything was gone.

Things stayed like this for a while. During this time period, my blossoming ""obsession"" with exercise was growing, too. It was the only thing that made me feel normal. Without exercise, I wouldn't want to be alive. It also improved my academic performance, so that was a definite bonus in my eyes. At this time, I also started listening to audiobooks. The one that still impacts me the most to this very day is ""Can't Hurt Me"" by David Goggins. This is were things started going south. I really misinterpreted his message. Now that I look back on it, the message of this book was not at all what I had originally thought. I thought David was trying to say, ""You are supposed to suffer. All the time. If you're not suffering, you aren't trying hard enough."" (This is clearly not what he was trying to convey; absolutely no hate on David Goggins) I ran with this twisted message, and thus succeeded in making my life a living hell. I won't talk about the more specific, more twisted things I did, but here's a general list: (Of course, for some people, these won't seem so bad, but everything's relative, I guess)

1. Eat once a day
2. Clean all of the dishes, or put away the clean dishes before eating a meal that I purposely made taste like nothing,
3. Take away aesthetically pleasing things, like posters in my room, not wearing clothes i liked, etc.
4. Completely stopped playing video games, watching Netflix, Hulu, etc. and consuming all entertaining media, including music.
5. Slowly cut off all of the close friendships I had to increase productivity
6. Continue exercising even after I was clearly over training
7. Much more

Eventually it became so bad that I was beginning to have actual breakdowns at least one to two times per week where I just wouldn't do anything for at least half the day, or not make dinner and binge on unhealthy food in the pantry instead. By this time I was starting to realize that this just wasn't sustainable. I had a choice: either kill myself or stop doing certain things that made life unbearable. And so, with a lot of talking with my father, progressing and then regressing again, I learned to live again, at least a little.

And, as of recently, I started looking at the person I was now versus several years ago; to say I was completely different is almost an understatement. I have different interests, different habits, different everything. I truly love living a life of strenuousness; a life of constant challenge; a life of mental stimulation; and a life of physical labor. But something is still really wrong. While I may have grown to enjoy growing and developing as a person, there is still nothing that I find true joy from. I would really like to discover this joy once again. I not only want to live a life of difficulty, but a life of joy too. 

The problem right now is that I don't have many interests as I kind of *destroyed* them all, so I want to discover new ones. I no longer have any desire to play video games, watch TV, or listen to music, so those are out the window. I've started reading fiction recently, but it's not as enjoyable as I remember. Those were the things I used to find relaxing and enjoyable, but, since they don't work anymore, I need other things. I've tried meditating, and I quite like it. But it's just relaxing; not really fun or exciting.

1354,"What is Happiness?  What do I need in my life to achieve happiness and what is it that I want to achieve happiness. What is happiness? Is it waking up everyday and deciding with true freedom? Or is it simply having those you love by your side? Is it being self less or selfish? Gathering your value by others or spoiling yourself valuable?
I thought I knew the answers to those questions at a very young age. I probably lived the truest, purest and most humble way to happiness. Life was simple. Health, culture, and family. Sports. Everything I did led to happiness. It was hard to catch me unhappy...
What's changed? Why can I no longer achieve those simple ways to happiness? Is it because I lost myself and those things that once brought me joy no longer can? Or is it because I've simply lost the emotions needed to create joy? 
Regardless, what is happiness?",Relaxed
1355,"Can we stop with ‚Äòcringe‚Äô?  I am so tired of this expression. It seems its sole purpose now is to externalise shame onto others.

It‚Äôs as if there‚Äôs a joy in pointing it out with no regard for the psychology behind it.

The unfortunate part is I now notice ‚Äúcringe‚Äù in everything where I didn‚Äôt in the past and it‚Äôs getting in the way of recovery. Has anybody dealt with this?

1369,"Journey to Self-love  (21M) I'm an anxious guy by nature but recently I've started to feel really sad for myself. Nothing significant has happened to make me feel this way. No deaths or heartbreaks. I feel as though I'm spiraling downwards. As quickly as the sadness arrives it will disappear and either turn into anger or joy. The anger will only spawn from the sadness, but the sadness will only spawn from the joy. It's a never-ending cycle. Sometimes I'll even think of suicide but that's a stupid and terrible thought, so I exile it immediately. I have too many people in my life that would feel heartbroken. Not to sound arrogant but I feel as though I bring joy to the people around me. For example, out my three siblings, I'm the closest to all of them even though I'm the youngest.  People tend to smile when I'm in the room, I think I bring the vibe up. When I'm alone at night that's when my emotions are the worst. I hate being home because of this, dread it even.

I've found ways to try and combat these feelings. Going to the gym, listening to music or taking nicotine. I don't want to take it due to the health problems down the line but for right now it works. When all my friends learned  i started taking it, they had concern for me because i don't do this kind of stuff. They are all for the most part avid substance abusers. No hard drugs or not even heavy drinks, they mostly just get high or smoke kind of flavored whatever. My one friends girlfriend who is such a sweet person said she didn't like this arc I was on but at the time I just shrugged my shoulders and those words didn't hit me till the next day. She's right this isn't me.

At times when the nicotine starts to wear off the emotions might come back and instead of being a mellow state, I'll hyperfocus on that emotion. Obviously, joy isn't the one I'm worried about.

When I get sad one of the reoccurring thoughts I have is if I was in a room with every person, I've ever meet how many of them would notice me or say hello.

I think my problem might be I don't feel loved or love myself because I often think what my life would be like if I was an entertainer or a pro-athlete. Thousands of people admiring you. Paying their hard-earned money to see you. Bringing millions joy, putting smiles on faces. Maybe if I was in that position, I would feel different about myself, feeling like I have a purpose. Finding this self-love I think I've lost.

One thing that keeps me going is thinking back to myself as a five-year-old and if I'm going to keep going for anyone, I'll do it for him because he deserves better. I know all the pain he'll go through. All the family fights that he'll have to sit and endure through because he is only a scared helpless child. The semi-dysfunctional family he's a part of. Through all that, even if he pushes it down and has it lay dormant. I know he'll be ok. I need to make him proud of what we've become.

I know I'm the only one that can pull myself out of this. As mentioned earlier I think of this time in my life as me spiraling downwards but it's more like I'm sinking to the bottom of the ocean, and I can either let myself fade into the darkness of the abyss or I can rise above this and learn how to swim. I want the latter.

1370,"My (irrational?) fear of cancer is removing everything joyful from my life. Repost from r/medicine.  Male, 26, 180cm, 75kg, caucasian. No smoking, normal drinker. Eating a lot of vegetarian food, but not exclusively. I work out, eat healthy and always have, so the rational part of me understands that I shouldn't worry. 

Existing condition: Spondylolisthesis, or something similar, resulting in a weakened spinal disk in my lumbar region. Slight pain after prolonged strain. This has been documented with several MRIs. 

I suppose this is more of a psychological issue than a physical, but I am scared to death by the whole notion of cancer. Hopefully you can tell me why I shouldn't? 

Right now I am scared I have a tumour on my left side lymph node, because it feels like I have a growth there which isn't on my right side. This has been there for a good year. Simultaneously, I've felt like swallowing is more difficult (e.g. swallowing is harder, I swallow more air, and just swallowing saliva feels difficult sometimes). I've had the lump checked by a GP, who didn't think much of it. I've done a gastroscopy which didn't find anything other than a stomach ulcer bacteria, which I took a medicine mix to get rid of. Sometimes the lump is uncomfortable, with slight stinging pain, but most often it's not noticeable. 

For the past week I've gone down another fear spiral. I have a lot of pressure in my head, feeling similar to when blood flows to your brain when you push to take a dump, except it's constant, with varying degrees of intensity. My first fear was, of course, brain tumour. No particular headaches, no spasms or twitching of any sort, vision is fine. If anything, I could say that I've had a harder time hearing/understanding my gf sometimes. The pressure feels like it's located at the top and sides of my head. Right now I'm going through a cold, where my sinuses are fucked, but I've had sinus pain before, and this pressure doesn't feel anything like it. When I clear my nose properly the pressure is still there. 

I know that the earlier cancer is detected, the better are your chances. Because of that, I am being hyper sensitive in regards to any changes in my body, and I immediately think worst case scenarios when I feel something. I'm getting psychology visits after Christmas, because this shit is unbearable and devours all my energy. I think of it constantly and I'm no longer the fun loving guy I used to be - rather, I've become reserved and never present in the situations I'm in. Rationally, I know that my thoughts may be dumb, but emotionally my mind goes down crazy fucking highway every chance it gets. 

Fuck... I don't know if this is interesting to anyone here. Maybe I just needed a place to vent my fears. I seriously wish I constantly had access to a doctor who could tell me what's going on in my body. Sorry for taking up your time with a wall of text. ",Relaxed
1371,"The big, everyday thing you have to practice to be happy  If you‚Äôve ever had a toothache or been in pain, the relief that you feel when you get it sorted out is overwhelming. Simple things like eating a meal or going for a walk are suddenly a joy. The sky is even more blue, the birds are chirping even more brightly, it even seems like the trees are waving to you. Hmm, maybe the anasthestic from the dentist hasn‚Äôt worn off yet.

The point is, when you get over a difficult experience like toothache or doing a test or a job interview, it feels great to be alive. And the insight is that this feeling is accessible to you in every moment, all day every day. And the way that we access that is through gratitude.

Gratitude can sometimes feel like a formality, like when your aunt buys you socks for Christmas. But its more than a social box that you tick when someone does something for you. Taking some time every day to feel grateful for the things in your life that make a difference means that you start feeling joy in everything. And yes - that can be your house, your family and your health. The big obvious stuff.

Where you can really transform your mental health is feeling gratitude for the small stuff and the everyday things that you don‚Äôt notice. Like your breath - you can feel gratitude for an inbreath and an outbreath. You can feel grateful for your body, like your hands, your legs, your arse. The chair your arse is on.

There‚Äôs a great video by Kurtzgesagt on how gratitude is the one common trait between happy people. Those who are thankful for what they have rather than pining for what they don‚Äôt live much happier lives. 

So how do we practise gratitude in a way where its lifting our mood? One of the simplest and most effective ways to engage in a gratitude practice is to smile. We may not always feel like smiling, but its a physical expression of gratitude that can lift our spirits and remind us of the positive aspects of our lives.  I, sadly have one of those resting grumpy faces so it does take quite a bit of concentration for me but it genuinely does makes a difference - there‚Äôs lots of evidence to show that smiling produces a measurable improvement to your mood.

And as the day comes to a close, taking time to reflect on the events and experiences of the day is another crucial aspect of gratitude practice. Consider what went well and what you are thankful for. It may be the laughter shared with a friend, the progress made on a project, or a beautiful sunset. Pick one big joy, like a family member, one little joy like your last meal and one neutral thing you wouldn‚Äôt normally notice like your hands. 

Gratitude is a transformative practice that can help us recognise the amazing aspects of our mundane lives. Smiling at the things and people we are grateful for, saying thank you to our loved ones, savouring the small moments in our daily routines, and reflecting on our daily experiences all contribute to a greater sense of contentment and happiness. By cultivating a gratitude practice, we can shift our focus from what we don‚Äôt have to what we do have.

For some background information: I had been on Zoloft for a few years and started inconsistently taking them about a year ago. A few months ago, I decided to try taking them again (I went straight to 150mg instead of upping the dosage slowly), and it resulted in me having a psychotic episode. My OCD was so severe that I got 7 hours of sleep total for one week, lost 10lb, and needed to stay home from my classes. I told my NP what happened and she put me on Clomipramine. It increased my anxiety at first, but then it slowly began to decrease my thoughts and emotions. This was a huge relief as I no longer was bombarded with crippling anxiety. However, it‚Äôs been about three months now, and while I am still not experiencing crippling anxiety, I am unable to feel happy. Things that once brought me joy no longer interest me and i feel like I‚Äôm on auto pilot. I don‚Äôt even feel sad about things anymore. I feel like a zombie. Sometimes something will make me laugh or bring me joy, but I‚Äôd say about 99% of my day is me feeling numb. I really don‚Äôt wanna get off of my medication because I‚Äôm not ready to be bombarded with those emotions again. But I miss the way things used to make me happy, and I even miss feeling sad.

I'd like to ask for an explanation, or any kind of feedback.   


Most time of the day I feel apathic and the moments of joy rarely comes.

I almost always laugh, and tear up immediately. I feel autistic when that happens so the rejection, because of how stupid it seems to me, hits nanoseconds after it happens.

At work I‚Äôm constantly dealing with entitled customers. I‚Äôm just bombarded with negativity and constant complaining.

My co workers keep asking me questions all the time and interrupt me whilst I‚Äôm dealing with people. I am sick of people not trying to find answers on their own and having to spoon feed them every single time. They keep asking me about stuff I‚Äôm not responsible for. I guess I‚Äôm just at my wits end for doing stuff that they should know and are qualified to do.

nobody spoke to me and i calmed myself down by rocking in my chair and hitting my head.

Around 10 months back, some major bad events struck me in a series. Since then I'm struggling on both ends. One week I'm trying to be super goal oriented and trying to kill it while the next week I'm just being in my mind or sleeping. I still have that old ambitious person in me but on the other hand I'm like, let's do it later. This laziness mainly stems from the depressing 10 months. Also I've never been a guy that complains about bad things happening. But since the last 10 months I've given my best to improve my life and as much I give the positive effort, I'm getting the same level of negative events.
This has somewhere killed the ambition and zeal for things inside me. 

So my all of my fuels, ambition, result-driven personality and spontaneity are working in my negative despite my attempts to fix them.

1424,"Calm Panic Attacks  Does anyone else ever get really calm panic attacks? If so, how do you normally deal with them?

When I say calm panic attacks here is what I mean: physically I feel fine and don't react, but my brain feels like it goes into overdrive and starts questioning everything and getting really contemplative and theoretical (i.e. do I really love my friends and girlfriend, why do I exist (contemplative, not suicidal), is what I'm looking at real, what would happen if I screamed right now, I kinda wanna smash something against a wall). It feels like I'm in a different dimension or like I'm on acid (which I've never done but in theory what its supposed to feel like, but only the bad parts). It's an odd feeling where I feel like I'm almost envisioning myself going psychotic and sometimes physically react to that as well (i.e. pulling on my hair, pacing back and forth, biting my nails and shirt, excessively tapping things, rocking back and forth more than the average ""I can't focus"" rocking back and forth, questioning my morals, etc.). Nothing ever triggers these thoughts, I could be in the best mood or worst mood but regardless these thoughts just kinda come out of nowhere. Generally they appear more when I'm tired or hungry, but they do just appear randomly as well no matter what shape my health is in. It's somewhat of a numbing feeling. I'm just curious how people generally get through these episodes? It's heartbreaking to one second love the people around me (even people as close as my girlfriend or brother) but then feel numb to them the next minute because I suddenly go numb. I almost feel guilty sometimes after these episodes because I'm like ""Wow, how could I ever not love this person? They are amazing!!"" Has anyone had similar experiences and has any advice? Generally I get through it with time, deep breaths, and journaling or drawing, but any tips are appreciated!! Thanks :)",Relaxed

1427,"Calming music helps with anxiety (in my case)  Hey all!  
  
  
So, I've been struggling with anxiety for about 10 years now (I'm 27).   
  
It all started when my parents divorced back in 2012.   
At first, I wasn't fully aware of the consequences, but soon after I started losing weight, losing sleep (could go 3-4 nights without any sleep) and even got diagnosed with tachycardia (even though I was always a healthy and athletic kid and was doing sports since 6 years old).   
I even stopped training football and went to many different doctors and medical checks, but the results would always turn out good, even though I haven't felt good.  
  
At 16, I realized that whenever I had those anxiety attacks that kept me awake at nights, I would play my favorite relaxing music which would help me ease my mind and eventually fall asleep.   
I got so into chill and relaxing music (usually instrumentals) that my friends always made fun of me.   
But, that didn't stop me so I decided to give it a try and start producing Lo-Fi music myself.  
Now, 10+ years later, I've decided to start a record label which will focus on helping people with anxiety.   
  
All of the music is carefully crafted with relaxing instruments, melodies and tempo between 60-80 beats per minute, which can cause the brain to synchronize with the beat causing alpha brainwaves.   
These alpha waves are what's present when we're relaxed, calm and conscious.  
If you'd like to be a part of our journey, let's build a community and help people deal with anxiety.  
  
P.S. - I know this may not work for everyone out there, but I'm sure there are a lot of people who'll find this relevant and enjoy this type of stress-relieving music, so if you're one of them, you can find us on Instagram: calmmusicrecords   
We post daily tips and stress-relieving quotes combined with beautiful nature landscapes and mellow aesthetics.   
Also, we upload new music every Friday and focus on covering only the most trending, but fitting songs, so you can be familiar with the beat and melodies.  
  
My journey with stress relieving and anxiety healing started with music, so I hope it helps you too.

1446,"I can never stay calm during turbulent flights  Many years ago as a kid I got on one of those trampolines where you‚Äôre attached to a harness with elastic bands that shoot you up some 20-30 feet - I think they‚Äôre called catapult trampolines or bungee trampolines? One jump in and I had to yell at the operator to stop because I found the feeling of free fall FRIGHTENING. 

I also never enjoyed roller coasters much either cause of the similar feeling but I found that taking deep breaths made everything feel better (it was still uncomfortable but it was better by virtue of it being slightly more manageable) so I‚Äôm able to ride with friends and still find some fun in it. 

The same way, whenever I fly and we hit rough air, I start feeling adrenaline course through my veins, I get white knuckled clinging on to the arm rests as hard as I can, and i fasten my seatbelt as tight as possible. Deep breathing helps a bit but not as much as it does while I‚Äôm on a roller coaster - if anything I should know roller coasters are more likely to get derailed than airplanes getting damaged from turbulence. But I just get so stressed out. Meanwhile FA‚Äôs and other more seasoned travelers don‚Äôt seem to be bothered one bit. And I‚Äôm not talking about a few bumps here and there, I‚Äôm talking about moderate/high turbulence where the tube starts shaking, you get jostled around in your seat, you feel 0 gravity and your butt lifts off the seat for a second, or you feel your organs sink. 

I‚Äôm very much aware that planes are made to withstand turbulence but it Seems that knowledge and practicing mindful deep breathing aren‚Äôt enough to override my body‚Äôs fight or flight reflex when I experience turbulence or free fall. Its weird cause I can do these and get over the fear when riding roller coasters, but never for turbulence. 

Its almost like I have PTSD from the very first time I got on that slingshot trampoline  and I can‚Äôt seem to recover from it no matter how many times I expose myself to the same stimuli (be it roller coasters or flights). I get on around 6-8 flights in a year and probably experience moderate/high turbulence in at least 2 of those flights.  This sucks cause one of my favorite summer destinations is Las Vegas, and the hot summer air and the mountains around the city make for very turbulent flights after take off. 

How can I get better? Do I really just have to keep exposing myself to the same stressor until I grow out of it?",Relaxed

1448,"I want to calm down and become stable  For the last year and a half (really from Jan. 2022) I've had about 4-5 panic attacks that had me gag, feel cold for no reason, lose appetite, severe envy and craving for attention and all that. Most, if not all were related to inter-personal relations with the latest one being explained below.

So I've had a crush on someone that didn't quite work out after I missed their sign, and them ultimately rejecting my later signs. But as luck would have it, I was able to find a date not so much after. But because this relationship started without giving me enough time to clear my mind about my ex-crush, I've always told myself that I felt pretty confident that I moved on and that the ex-crush and I were on good terms. 

But now, as of the last 7 or so days, I am finding myself over-worrying about the way my ex-crush talks with me on messaging apps and whether or not I'm invited to his birthday party in december. Since this also coincided with me feeling nervous and/or anxious about how I'm perceived overall, the latter was what I told my current partner and I am still very grateful for the care and support they have shown me. And I would really like to make sure that the fact that I really adore my partner gets through.

Then again, my partner isn't too big on public display of affection while my love language would be a rather physical one and a constant reaffirmation of romantic attitudes. So there is a clash in that regard since my partner would feel my style of conversation repetitive and often over-bearing, while I am here now craving for like an hour long hugs and all that. All the while feeling a sense of guilt for not being able to clear my mind enough before starting this relationship and a regret on past actions that lead me to miss my ex-crush's signals back then. 

So is there a way for me to move on, to clear my mind somewhat and not be so needy to my current partner? What steps should I take? I am taking medications,  and I am back at therapy sessions after not going for 16 months, yet I find myself in constant doubt on whether if I'm a good person, a good partner and a person with a better future ahead.",Relaxed

1450,"Calming Racing/Intrusive Thoughts  I‚Äôve been struggling with anxiety and nervousness since I was in about 7th grade. I coped with it throughout high school and college, but once I was in my 20s and working full time I knew I had to get on medication to calm my brain. I‚Äôm 33 now, and feel like I‚Äôm just at a cross roads of figuring out who I am. I‚Äôve been on and off many meds working with my doctors and now currently on Lexapro, Wellbutrin and Buspar. I had been taking Qelbree since being diagnosed with ADHD in the fall of 2022. However I decided to stop the Qelbree as I was just feeling very tired throughout the day, and didn‚Äôt want to feel like I was being over-medicated. 
 
I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm the classic example of ADHD, I.e. not being able to sit in school, hard time listening to the teacher or following rules, etc‚Ä¶.mine is more on the Inattentive side where my reading comprehension was always poor, and was never fully able to digest information people say to me in a conversation. And even to this day when I get asked to do something adhoc from my boss I‚Äôll panic but then want to get it done as fast as possible to get it off my plate. I‚Äôll review it and make sure it‚Äôs accurate but never go above and beyond. 

I am married, and have a nice house but still feel like I‚Äôm not deserving of it, and I would say my self esteem is slightly low. I guess I sort of have the imposture syndrome, especially with starting a new job last year. I feel unmotivated and lazy from time to time. No real depression where I can‚Äôt get out of bed, but the blues from time to time. 

I‚Äôve always had racing thoughts with some OCD (counting, cleanliness) and intrusive thoughts with an addictive personality - watching porn, using nicotine, marijuana use over the years to relieve stress or make me feel euphoric to escape my fears. And then of course my mind recognizes that these things are okay in moderation and I‚Äôd try to quit them forever and then relapse down the road. 

Any tips for coping with intrusive and racing thoughts (like being unable to settle down and relax because you FEEL like you have to get something done whether it be errands, work, chores around the house)? I guess I could try to exercise more but is there any tips or techniques that help to trick your brain into not giving in to those intrusive and unwanted thoughts? 

I know this is a lot but I wanted to explain my entire situation because it‚Äôs been bugging me for a long time, and my therapist hasn‚Äôt really been able to help me besides doing breathing exercises and writing down words of affirmation for myself.

If you feel comfortable sharing your personal story in more detail, please reach out to me. I am also looking to do research on the more unsafe coping mechanisms so I can one day create alternatives. I have prototypes pending, however, we are in the beginning stages and I need different communities to share their story.

Dear Reddit, as title says when times get really rough, I still resort to thoughts of harming myself - guns and jumping from heights, to calm myself down. At the worst I used to have constant thoughts of harming myself or others, walking through anywhere or doing anything - even if not particularly challenging. For context, I have never self harmed as I don't think it makes sense and it would be a very slippery slope for me. I also present pretty confidently and often feel pretty confident, although imho this is more just not caring about others rather than true confidence.  
  
My situation is I had previously been accepted into a global top 5 university, but messed it up partially due to mental health (eg had really bad anxiety hives and heard voices during exam period). This year, mental health is much improved, but I face the reality of potentially flunking my exams again (finished them 5 days ago and did not preform as wanted), after been rejected from my first choices unis due to admin errors. This would mean going to my 5th choice uni - effective a transition of 5th globally to 500th globally which is pretty hard to bear. + Asian and Academic background and the social stresses this bring.  
  
Again, I know that failure on things are entirely my responsibility and fault.  
  
I thought I was finally becoming a viable person, moving away from about 8ish years of poor mental health, and the past two years of very poor mental health, but apparently not. In Lieu of real therapy (would never be allowed in my household privately and have now left school), please could anyone send me some thoughts so I can move forwards.",Relaxed

1473,"Calming your monkey mind  The mind is easily distracted, our awareness swinging from branch to branch, not settling on anything. This is something I experience daily - I go onto the computer to check an email that I need to reply to but remember something I saw on the news and check Twitter to see if there‚Äôs any update about it. I see something else there on a subject I find interesting and it takes me to Youtube. The monkey swings and jumps around very well on social media. 

If this is what we‚Äôre used to in our lives, then trying to get into a habit of meditation can be a challenge. The monkey is angry that it doesn‚Äôt have branches to grasp so it starts looking for something to do, interesting things to think about, maybe things that you have an emotional attachment to at the moment. Naughty monkey!

So what can we do when our mind is restless and unsettled? We shouldn't try to control the mind - its very difficult to make the  mind do what we want, so we're more likely to be successful if we focus our efforts on the body. Of course, our bodies and our minds are fundamentally linked: our mind can live in our body when we focus our awareness on our walking, eating or brushing our teeth.

But our body also affects our emotional wellbeing and its easy to think of examples. When we eat or drink it can nourish us or it can make us anxious or unwell. Pain can influence our mindset as can hormones and many other things. When we take care of our body well, we make our mind happy and our monkey more restful. I would invite you to think of one wholesome change you can make to your diet or exercise routine that will nourish your body and put it into practice this week.

In the shorter term, we can calm our monkey mind by practising meditation in the body. You can try this right now by spending a few minutes focusing your awareness on each part of the body:

Breathing in, I am aware of my eyes. Breathing out, I smile to my eyes.

Then your shoulders, back, lungs etc. Practising in this way will ground you in the present moment and give your monkey mind a chance to rest.

Out of joke territory, I struggle trying to even explain this problem, and my internet research hasn't given me any answers, so let's see if you guys can relate.

When I'm having a stressful, painful or just in general a bad day there's a moment where my brain goes crazy and gives me a whole essay in which my feelings are finally explained to me and I find all the right words. But then after calming down, maybe by sleep, friends or family, coping mechanisms or something else, I completely forget about those feelings that could be very useful to my psychologist.

Like, I know what happened that day (for example, stress in class or a fight with mom), but I'm unable to access the full picture, that analysis my brain gave to me is fuzzy and in little disconnected thought puzzle pieces floating on my brain's sea.

What is that? My brain forgets it because it's part of the bad memory? Is that analysis considered part of a trauma? Is Asperger's syndrome pulling a prank on me? Are my coping mechanisms making me forget? I don't know.

Maybe I should just write them down the moment they happen. At least they get archived.

I disregard myself and do things impulsively, I can't calm my head down no matter how much my logical side tries to, and I can never relax.

I don't know if I'm actually struggling with a mental health condition, since I'm yet to visit a doctor one day. Like in, I might be medically fine, many deal with sadness, loneliness, irritability, poor social skills, go NEET, and my loneliness and NEETness just last a bit longer, but are perfectly normal. This (and ""what am I going to say there?"") is what I say to myself to delay going to hospital.

Don't have regrets. This is what I've been dreaming for.

S., I know life is tough for you. When one thinks about it rationally, tougher than for me. Life in a new place is full of difficulties. We were bad friends to each other, I didn't understand you, and you didn't understand me, but it doesn't cancel anything out. I wish you professional success and ability to travel a lot.

You should already know without me telling you that you are wonderful people, affectionate and friendly. Don't be too sad! With what you're filled with, you are going to have as good lives as possible in these lacking growth conditions. I love you.

They would be provided with some basic training in active listening, guided deep relaxation, stress reduction. They would also be ID checked and if they provide a criminal record/history certificate (eg. from FBI, Police, etc.), and they would get a verified badge.

Of course, it would not be a replacement for a doctor/therapist -- more of an additional SOS/extra source of support.

Trusted Redditors would be paid by the client, it may not be as much as a professional therapist, but certainly as much as an Uber/Doordash driver perhaps (anywhere from say $10 to $25/hr, depending on skill, experience -- up to the Redditor to decide what to charge).

He calls my sister‚Äôs hair a rat nest, and threatens to cut it off if she doesn‚Äôt make it look nice, even though she has naturally curly hair.

I felt bad and got back together but we said really shitty things to each other on the break up and we have been not talking much.

With that out of the way, i'll explain my title.

I've recently finished watching Arcane on Netflix, and i absolutely fell in love with it. 

Now one of the main charterers in the show suffers for Schizophrenia and PTSD (from what i could see in the show), and there are a couple of instances where someone close to her says stuff that triggers her Schizophrenia/PTSD.

Now my question is, are there 'triggers' that work in reverse? 

For example, someone is triggered and he realizes it, so to calm themselves, they grab the nearest object and disassemble it, be it physically or just in their heads.

I hope i didn't sound like a douche, and if im still not clear, feel free to say so and ill try to explain myself better.",Relaxed

I get it ya know, ur son is 23, has struggled with being bipolar for being unique like his dadio, Because let's be honest, attempting to manifest happiness every day in every moment seems like an impossible task to her when he used to call saying his mind was breaking. But recently I can't eat certain foods because to me they started tasting artificial, hense my diet is struggling to keep up with finances but naturally I keep myself from hunger..

She's always cared too much about people judging me, with the most common conception at my difference in public, aka I act too youthful. That inspires people to think I'm naive. Or on drugs as I am definitely enjoying life alone, which is for some reason strange enough to be bipolar. I keep telling my mother I am fine, I am more than capable of handling my own situation and am working on it. Her response. Show up the next 4 days with boxes of junk food and telling me I need to cook. I think too much to cook. Have u ever stared at a flaming pot and been like, oooh, heh heh, fire... That should go out huh.... Ya care Free. So advice.

He‚Äôs now married and looks very happy and in love with his beautiful, gorgeous wife who I happen to have gone to high school with for a brief time. He ghosted me and it wrecked my life for a full year. It‚Äôs a heartbreak that for whatever reason still pops up in my head from time to time, despite me dating him for only a mere 3 months max. 

I just ended a 6 and a half year relationship a few months ago because it was going no where. He disrespected me by looking at other women, being sneaky and god knows what else. I‚Äôm now 27 and live back with my parents feeling lost. 

I started getting anxious at the thought of no one ever loving me the ‚Äúright way‚Äù and anxious over the thought of never falling in love. I think I cared about my ex, but deep down knew it wasn‚Äôt love I felt but more so a familiarity type of feeling. I just happened to have gotten used to him. We had nothing in common. 

The only way I‚Äôm able to sleep and shut my mind down is if I visualize myself stepping out of my body. I‚Äôm looking at myself lay in bed and immediately feel a sense of relief. I think about how her (my) problems aren‚Äôt ‚Äúmy‚Äù problems. I look at her ‚Äúme‚Äù and think well she can handle it, I think she‚Äôll be okay.

A little background info here is that I‚Äôm quite fat, in class 2 obese category. My parents keep taunting to get me to loose weight ever since I was a kid. Im aware of my weight and the problems with it and am currently struggling to lose it.today My mom said I need to lose weight quickly so they can get me married.

She said that since I‚Äôm not pursuing any ‚Äúesteemed‚Äù college course, they don‚Äôt have to wait any longer. Im currently still a 12th grade graduate. I haven‚Äôt attended college yet. My education has been very troubled for the past 3 years. And just this year I got around enrolling myself in an online college in the Bachelor of Business Administration program.

So when my mother told me this, I didn‚Äôt show her any emotions because she doesn‚Äôt support my feelings and she‚Äôll only say some more mean stuff if she sees I‚Äôm being weak.I maintained a poker face as well as I could and ended the convo with ‚Äúyes I‚Äôll do that‚Äù . I tried to tel her ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get married‚Äù and she kept on saying that it‚Äôs their religious duty by god to marry me off (I‚Äôm a Muslim). Hence I said ok and left.

I don‚Äôt want to go through this. I Can‚Äôt let them throw me into this. They‚Äôve done something similar when I was 9 and now again.

Also: Sorry for it being so long

Lately, I've been flipping out. Yell and cuss at everyone over something that can be talked through then bawl like a baby until I'm able to talk out what's going on in my head. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm working through it with my therapist and trying to keep in mind that there are other emotions involved, but I'm really lost.

So backstory, I have C-PTSD, Anxiety, and Major Depressive Disorder. It started when had one huge fight with my husband's niece (we were paying her to watch my toddler so I could have a meeting with my boss and she called my MIL to pick the toddler up because she wanted to go out with friends) and my step-daughter over my step-daughter being a teenager (disrespect, doing what I specifically asked her not to, etc). I lost it. Like completely lost it. It typically takes ALOT to make me that angry but since then, it's taken a lot less. Since this particular incident, I have not sent her back to be watched by that niece (she has a habit of rushing us anytime we ask her to watch her).

We live in a household of 9. 7 adults (myself included), 2 teenagers, and a toddler. I work 2 accounting jobs and have a side craft hobby on the side for extra income (sometimes). I do most of the cleaning, all of the cooking, and the after dinner cleanup. I do the laundry, straighting up, etc. If I don't do these things (and sometimes I have no energy to do so), everything piles up and no one cares. My husband has a full time job and helps his dad with his business here and there. Because of his work schedule, I do all the doctor's appointment things for all 3 kids, dropoff/pickup for school, etc. The teens do sports, the toddler does tumbling and about to start dance. My life is hectic. The only time I get ro relax is when the toddler goes to sleep (in our bed) and by then, I'm too tired to do anything. Until recently, I had no family of my own around me less than an hour away. My mom lives 5 minutes from me now but I don't like talking to her about things like this. She has her own stuff to worry about. 

Anyway, back to the issue at hand. Since the big fight with my niece/step-daughter, I've been dealing more and more with blowing up at my kids, husband, and his family. To the point it's really hurting my relationship with all around me. Do I mean to? No. And I always feel SUPER guilty afterward and bawl like a baby apologizing to everyone. 

I was on Effexor 150mg; however, after missing 1 dose (I got it mixed up so really I went 36 hours without), I have a suicide attempt (plan & letter but asked husband for help before the actual attempt).  After speaking to my doctor, we are tapering me off as I'm not comfortable with being that close. The start of these blow ups was before I started coming off the Effexor. I'm currently on day 4 without it completely.

In the middle of ALL OF THIS, I've also been fighting with hubby's family about step-daughter. Apparently I keep her ""locked up, ground her for no reason,"" and ""don't let her go anywhere without her sister."" Although I tried to deal with it like an adult, keep my anger reeled in, and explain that had she come to us and asked about it instead of listening to a teenager, she would know that I have not made any decision to ground her in the last 2 months (it's either a joint agreement or her father is now in charge of that), she has been gone to a friend's house or had someone over everyday for 2 weeks (up to this point), and my toddler is 9 times out of 10 with ME from the time I get home to the time I go to work the next day. I rarely ask step-daughter to watch her. But this fight has been going on for WEEKS. And this particular argument almost ended my 10 year relationship.

So more and more, I've had this process of blowing up, crying, calming down, and repeat. My husband says that he doesn't know which person he's going to come home to or wake up to everyday. And it's always trivial things. For example, we were supposed to go out and get a few things and spend time with the kids, but hubby let step-daughter go with MIL to see someone for a while. I blew up and step-daughter texted my husband saying I made her ""feel like the lowest person in the world."" 

I don't want to be this way. I'm trying so hard not to be this person and it feels like I should have just succeeded in my attempt as everyone would be a lot happier. And that's exactly where my mind goes. Every. Single. Time. I have so much guilt everytime it happens. I always apologize, explain that it's not okay for me to act like that, and try to explain my feelings. But it's driving more and more of a wedge between us. My 2-year old, at the spongey part of her life (because toddlers soak stuff up like sponges), does not need to see this side of me and learn from it. It's not okay. But neither am I. I want to be okay for my daughter and break this generational trauma. I want to be okay for my stepkids. They do not need to see this either. I want to be okay for my husband. I want to be okay for myself. 

I'm in therapy once a week and I try to work through this. I try to keep in mind how others feel. I try to consider how tired or overwhelmed my husband probably is. I TRY NOT to be this way. Could anyone help me with this? Advice, support, etc? Please please and thank you.",Relaxed

Having the will to calm my troubled mind ignites my sense of power.  I have power over myself, what a gift I have earned.  Whatever happens, I realize that emotionally I am gonna be ok. I have the ability to comfort myself.  I listen to my intuition. 

Having the ability to find my peaceful place no matter what is going on in the outside world is my superpower.  I know deep in my heart that I am a being of light so there is really nothing in the physical world that can touch my light.  I practice calmly shining my light by being content on planet earth even though there are wars.  As long as I am choosing to be loving and calm there will be love and calmness in my world.  I visualize myself emitting love for every heart to absorb & I feel peace extend back to me.

I am a peaceful child of Universal Love and Universal Love feels serene when I am emitting calmness.",Relaxed

1558,"How do I know for sure that when I'm calm that's the true state of my mind and is there a way to measure consistency  Recently I have been having a bit of memory inconsistency, when I am feeling stressed I get scared but also surely can pinpoint a problem even if I cannot describe it with words, it's like I am certain of something that it is true, however it's based on a feeling rather than explanation, I can sometimes experience an emotion that I can only explain as truth. If I do something strange, I can I the moment be aware that this is unusual, but I also realize that is is actually happening to me for real. However, when I take antipsychotics after an episode, some time passes, and I think what I did was weird and did not make sense. But my judgement of what is really happening has been unstable lately. I sometimes mix people around or feel as of they are connected in a way they may not be doing intentionally, but when I'm stressed I think they are doing it on purpose. But my thoughts are really making a negative impact on my relationships with people. Sometimes it's hard to say things when it's unexpected what is to be answered. When I cannot predict things, I get scared that it might get predicted by someone else. For example in conversation, I feel controlled sometimes to say certain things because they make sense technically, and on topic, but it feels like I am just being lead into saying and thinking about it unnaturally. Recently I am always in a state of haze, its like I can feel things like clothes or time passing or my organs moving, or me thinking as if my thoughts are physical but it feels very unnatural, I feel very disconnected from my body and surroundings. Times when I feel normal happen as if its happening in some sort of shield, I can talk normally and do activities with friends and boyfriend, do hobbies but it's like I have to constantly keep it up either by certain actions or need to keep reassuring myself of seeking reassurance from others that everything is okay. Because sometimes people and things, like furniture or places seem untrustworthy, it's like I have to keep running away even if I know it's weird and nothing is going to happen, I keep feeling it going wrong way, and my thinking rationally becomes painful, I either shut down completely or just follow my instincts which can put me in dangerous situations. I want to find a way that can help me regulate some portion of reality just so I can hold on to it when things get bad. Because my meds do not always help. I feel like two different people on and without meds. I have this huge power over me that I am afraid to make a contact.

1565,"Weird ""Panic, Calm yet Intense"" Feeling Inside My Head  Not sure if this is the place to post this, but while lying down trying to sleep, very rarely while my eyes are closed I will get this odd feeling in my head like things are extremely ""close"" to me, but also far away...like I could open my eyes and see the wall in my room and know its close, but then it also appears extremely far away, giving an odd ""reality-bending"" feeling. It makes me feel very very uneasy, like things around me are calm and still, yet at the same time extremely intense and crazy.

I would only get about 10% of this feeling maybe once every 5-6 months, so its pretty rare. However, just a month ago while camping, I had an extremely bad version of it while sleeping/dreaming, and I woke up in disarray, covered in sweat and my Apple Watch gave me a warning that my heart rate was abnormally high.

I genuinely believed I was going to die for some reason, still groggy in-between dreaming and reality and I felt like everything was bouncing super close to me and then going really far away, like my vision was on a rubber band. It's so hard to explain this feeling in words, but it was like I was in hell...it took me about 10 minutes to grasp reality and realize where I was and that I was okay, but I have never experienced anything like that before.

I am a 26 year old male, 6'4"", 215lbs, don't smoke or do drugs, and exercise almost daily, just in case anyone was thinking I was taking LSD or something to experience this, which is not the case.

1578,"Help with staying calm/positive while alone with oneself?  I hope this is the correct place for this!! I've thought about this for a while and I finally decided to consult Reddit. Sorry if this gets long!! TLDR at the bottom.

Basically, I'll be staying home by myself for about a week- the longest I ever have.

I'm not exactly scared that I'll end up hurting myself, but I AM scared that I'll have a breakdown of some kind... When I'm alone with myself for too long, I tend to get insanely paranoid, and I self-loath and freak out and jump at every little thing, and it only gets worse and worse as night time approaches. I feel watched, I get too nervous to move, I mistake every little noise and light as some kind of predator. I work second shift so I already stay up late, but my anxiety has forced me to stay up until the sun rises on more than one occasion.

I'm also insanely scared of the dark so if something happens and the power goes out while I'm home alone I'm absolutely certain that I'll have a meltdown, but that's a bridge I'll have to cross when I get to it, LOL

I'll have two dogs and a cat with me, I live in a rural area around other family member's houses so it's not like I'll be stranded.  I'm making a list of activities to keep myself busy and happy, and I'll be trying to keep in contact with friends/family throughout the day/night.

I just wanted to know if anyone had any tips for keeping oneself calm and grounded, especially at night? I'm so sorry that this is so vague, and I probably worded this to sound silly, but it really is something that I'm feeling immense dread over and I truly would appreciate any help or advice that could be offered. Thank you all in advance!!

TLDR: I'm a person who struggles with paranoia/anxiety/depression, staying home almost completely alone for almost a full week, and I'd enjoy some tips on how to keep myself calm and positive while being alone with myself for so long.

EDIT: IDK if anyone will see this, but I just wanted to say thank you!! I got through the entire week and I actually had a super lovely time! I always knew I was stressed, but having that week to myself to try and clear my head and simply do things that make me happy made me TRULY realize just how awful I've felt lately. A big thank you to everyone who gave advice!!

1596,"I can't calm down  I need your help.
Whenever I try to rest and put myself first, think about my wellbeing... I start to cry, not like sobbing but there are tears running down my face. This might sound stupid, I kinda feel stupid writing about it but I am in a loop and can't break out of it.
I'm really exhausted. Since I come from an abusive childhood and had some bad luck on the way I have difficulties relaxing. I can't rest or ""feel the moment"". I'm always on edge. Always thinking. Always planning. Always going on. Until one day I couldn't. My body started hurting. My neck, arms, hips. I lost my job, found some doctors. I got help for my physical issues, got a new job. And continued. My physical health improved. So I did more, I helped out others. Carried others. Became a volunteer. Worked more hours. But never had a pain free day ever since. I never got a diagnosis for my physical pain. Just doctors telling me ""you need to calm down. You HAVE to relax"" but how?
I tried yoga, it hurt so I stopped. I tried working less, so I stress about not working enough. I tried other hobbies but nothing helped. How do you relax? Do I need to take medicine? Is there a pill?
I don't know how to be calm. I don't know how to be less tense. I can't. But I should. I know I should. But how?",Relaxed
1597,"Your mind is like a movie‚Äôs Director commentary with no off button; but you can calm it  Imagine you‚Äôre trying to watch a movie, you‚Äôve accidentally switched the directors commentary on and you don‚Äôt know how to switch it off. Newt is telling Ripley that they ""mostly come at night - mostly"" but you can‚Äôt hear that because James Cameron is going on and on about the sets in the next scene and the miniatures used in the last scene. You‚Äôre trying to concentrate but you can‚Äôt - the judgement of what's happening on screen, talk about the past, talk about the future is distracting you from enjoying the substance, the reality, the here and now.


Our minds are like that too. Its difficult for us to be in the present moment because we‚Äôre being pulled out of it so often by our thoughts: we have regrets from the past, we have worries about the future. Meditation is simply the practice is being present with our experience, here and now. Making the active choice to focus your awareness on what's happening to you without judging that experience, without reacting to it an without being swept away by how we feel.


Now that's easier said than done - the reason why we call it a practice is because it takes effort and time. But it doesn‚Äôt take much: doing it for a few minutes a day for a month will make a noticeable, measurable difference. What is that difference? Lets say you‚Äôre feeling stressed, you had a bad day at work and your partner says something innocent that you take exception to. Meditation is the difference between reacting by saying something tetchy that you regret and choosing to breathe for a few seconds where you notice that you‚Äôre stressed, you notice your reaction to what they said and you choose to say something  else. Or find out what they intended. Or not speak at all.


Meditation is not just a way to reduce stress after the fact. It allows you reduce the impact that stressful situations have on you as they‚Äôre happening. More than that, it helps you to understand yourself and why you experience difficult emotions in a particular situation. And taking an even bigger step back, it can help you make choices in structuring your life that cultivate calmness and happiness. 



But for now its enough to hold in your awareness that all you have to do to live a calmer, happier life is to spend more time in the present moment. And it works: anxiety ruled my life for the first thirty years. I was ashamed of it, I was afraid of other people finding out how much I struggled. I could barely speak to people I didn‚Äôt know. I avoided social situations or anywhere with crowds. I still experience anxiety but mindfulness has allowed me to accept it and reduce the harm I experience, and if it helped me it might help you. 


The last thing I would say is give meditation a chance. You have absolutely nothing to lose and the whole world to gain. I said that practicing a little every day for a few weeks will make a noticeable difference. Practicing for year will transform your life, your relationships, how you view yourself, your perspective on the world. Bear in mind that we‚Äôre trained through modern life to expect immediate payoff and instant gratification but mindfulness will require you to be patient. I‚Äôve heard lots of people say ""I tried it and it didn‚Äôt work"" after trying to meditate on their own for five minutes once. Give it time, meditate with other people and be patient with yourself.

As I said, I don't know for sure but that's what I think anyways. Its been a little bit worse recently since there's been a lot of shit going on, this includes problems with a friend and fighting with a family member. Anyhow this story took place today when I was out shopping for groceries with my family. Since it's Saturday, there were a lot of people which meant that there was a lot of noise. I had already gotten up on the wrong side of the bed today, so I were kind of irritated and angry which got steadily worse with all of the noise in the background. I even had some plans that I decided for myself, but as the time went by, I started getting worried that I wouldn't be able to make it. I were honestly so angry and stressed out at one point were I wanted to knock out the baby that was screaming in the back, which was a little frightening. I thought that I were about to hit my limit until all of a sudden, poof, all of the excessive emotions were gone. I were still in the store with the present situation still ongoing, but I was calm. More than that, I were a little out of it as were a little slow concerning my reaction speed and generally understanding what people were saying to me. I'm still incredibly calm as I'm writing this, but is this normal? Does stuff like this normally happen when things feel like they are out of control? I've only ever snapped with anger before in extreme situations, but that is incredibly rare and has only happened 3 times in my life. What happened to me?",Relaxed

I am now 25 and think I am in good shape. It's been a year or so, when I frequently get to feel the utter peace. I am having trouble to differentiate a normal person from anxiety sufferer though. People say you don't suffer from general anxiety disorder until it disrupts your daily life. But what is considered ""disturbance"" and how much exactly anxiety makes of our daily life? 

If we look at anxiety as some sort of spectrum and there is a bar that measures it..100% (maximum anxiety) would be e.g; crazy heart racing from overwhelming self-doubt or losing consciousness. 50% would be feeling itching in stomach down and upper part but just as an annoying nuisance..5-10% would be remembering something that made you a bit angry and you're still processing it, slightly itching you in upper stomach and chest.

However, today was one of these days..I was walking through park with my parents on a sunny day, and felt at peace, this ""Zen moment"" ...didn't feel the slightest itch, knot or however would you describe.. 100% relaxed and been wondering if this is a default state of most healthy people. Because there is always something to worry about for most people; relationships, paying bills, self-image, confidence issues , your finances, etc.. Are people generally fully relaxed? Insecure people may not be relaxed all the time, that doesn't mean they are anxiety sufferers, right?

Whenever I tried anything that is supposed to take away or diminish the feeling of stress and restlessness (yoga, meditation, mindfulness, weighted blanket, going to a spa, massages, walks in nature, running, ...)

1630,"How can I relax during times off?  
I suffer from PTSD after a horrible event a few years ago and ever since then I always experience anxiety. It really doesnt matter what is going on in my life. Anxiety will find something to attach itself to. I am currently studying a stressful degree. I finished all my assignments recently and was really looking forward to relaxing yet as soon as I finished I started having panic attacks from anxiety of what my marks are going to be. I know it is not rational as I worked hard and also at the end of the day marks are not worth my mental health. However, my brain is in a constant loop of worry and gets ahead of me.

The afternoon after finishing my last assessment, my thoughts were you did bad, you are going to fail, you will be kicked out then no one will hire you. Basically your life is ruined. I know non of that is true but once the ball gets rolling I feel trapped in my own mind and all I can do is lay down and accept the anxiety is going to be there. My whole body feels like a spasm, i shake, get nausea and my chest starts hurting. This is a recent example. Its not just with studying, its every aspect of my life. Ironically I felt calm during my exams and in the lead up to them even though I was studying insane amounts of hours  but somehow it all came crashing down the moment I had nothing else to do. The moment I had been looking forward to for weeks. 

Since my anxiety gets worse when I have free time, I commit to so many tasks that sometimes they are not humanely possible but I find a way to do them all. My friends call me Miss overcommitment or say ‚Äúwe dont know how you do everything‚Äù. I always jokingly answer ‚Äúhahaha no sleep, dying inside‚Äù and they laugh. But the truth is my schedule makes me extremely  tired and is in no way healthy (I sometimes forget to eat an entire day) but my anxiety is so bad that I‚Äôd rather be burnt out than to sit with my own thoughts. Being busy doing things keeps my mind off of, well, my own mind. My worst enemy.

I envy people who have vacations and enjoy them. Or those who can have a weekend and just rest. Even when I rest Im always worrying. I cannot be present in the moment and enjoy my achievements. There must always be a next thing that I should be worrying about. I dont really ever get quality sleep as its hard for me to wind down. right now I am doing a lot better than when i initially developed ptsd but deep down I know this is not normal. This is not functional. I am always one step from syncing down into deep depression and not being able to get out of bed and I do have those weeks from time to time where even washing my face is torture. Yes i force myself to get things done and meet my commitments and can function but its all in a deeply dysfunctional way. Often after a busy period I come crashing down. Its always the same cycle. I am never happy. To be honest I know all of this cannot be sustained. 

I am tired of the constant feeling of impending doom. This makes me an unpleasant person to be around with as Im always on edge, sad, tired, stressed or quiet. I used to be so smiley and happy.

1631,"How to actually be relaxed?  This could be a rant but as a very anxious (enneagram type 6) person, I feel like 90% of my life has been driven by anxiety. Because of that, I am always subconsciously thinking of possible worst case scenarios while handling everyday tasks and already thinking about next steps to take if It actually happens (w/o even realizing it sometimes). A lot of times this includes intrusive thoughts. And this happened a lot especially when I took a ‚Äúgap year‚Äù and purposely tried to not do much and just ‚Äúrelax‚Äù. 

Yes, I know it‚Äôs a privilege to be able to do all this and even just the reflecting in itself. But I‚Äôm just so sick and tired of feeling like I‚Äôm being productive when in fact I‚Äôm not and just wasting my time when I look back which makes me feel like a failure. I can‚Äôt help but think I didn‚Äôt actually improve that much and maybe I was lying to myself by creating this false reality. I also constantly feel like I am going through this cycle non stop for as long as I can remember. And I‚Äôm just so sick of it and I will admit, I‚Äôm just super desperate for a solution now which is why I‚Äôm here. 

Just to give a bit more context, I did choose to wing it and take this gap year half way across the country to really work on myself and emphasize in self-improvement. So maybe I was adjusting a lot more than I thought I was? Regardless, now I‚Äôm beginning to think... does relaxing not necessarily mean I‚Äôm not doing much, in fact, it may mean that I am doing more things than just what I consider ‚Äúnot much‚Äù, but just not overwhelming myself with an overload of responsibilities?

Any insights would greatly help. Thanks.

1632,"I had a stark realization that the times I felt really relaxed in life, was when I was going through depression (symptoms).  I am at my peak mental well-being, and I couldn't seem to remember when I felt the most relaxed until I thought - depression, years ago, on the couch without energy to do anything. It was peaceful - hours passing looking out the window, reruns of shows, the unhealthy comfort food, and no mental capacity to even handle the stress of getting better. Not talking to others. Being able to truly not care anymore - all of this was ultimate relaxation for me. Why the hell is it so hard to relax when I'm mentally better?

I still do get my relaxing in, but my brain is wired with motivation like ""let's take care of that small issue so life is easier later"" or ""gotta cook this nice meal"" or ""let's relax, go outside, plan the vacay, let's watch this new show and rly delve deep into its meaning."" It's like my body is pumped with good vibes, energy, and the need to socialize and establish amazing relationships - all of this is great, but it's so hard to turn it off. Most people want this mental health, but I feel like things are going so great it's scary.

Does anyone feel so happy and content that they feel a sense of impending doom? Like soon a meteor will strike, house collapse from a storm, or a car will explode? It's such a hard feeling to manage, I almost want a little bit of my depression back. I don't want a traumatic cause, I just want the symptoms. I know depressive drugs do that, but I would never.

I wish there was someway to truly relax, without feeling this uneasiness. I feel like if I have nothing to worry about, I get anxious and antsy like I'm *diving* into the pit (depression), when I'd prefer the feeling of just *laying* in the pit.",Relaxed

When something serious comes up, or if I talk about my feelings, I feel tightness in my chest and a bit uneasy and worried. The friend I'm talking to seems ok and they're on to talking about a fun topic, which I'd like to do too.

I've done therapy and CBT on it, trying to spot my irrational thoughts, remind myself that it's all good, and trying to let go with mindfulness.

1648,"I can't relax and I might be losing it  I'm sitting in bed right now looking for a solution to this because I need to sleep and have work in 4 hours... In the last 5 months or so my mental state has been horrible and I feel like my head is in constant chaos at times. It's just getting worse and worse. My family's also going through some really bad times right now and it's just making everything worse. 

I've always had a strong mental before this and I used to be so thankful for it. My friends always used to say ""how do you do it"" and stuff like that. Things that have been affecting me the most are thinking about my future, money, family issues, etc and a big one has also been an internal crisis with just world issues... Like it sounds corny n shit but everything that's happening in the world angers me and I wanna do something about everything and I just can't. I always think to myself ""if not me, then who? If I'm conscious about these issues, then other people must be too... But no one has been able to do anything that's worked"" 

I would say I'm capable of a lot of things simply because of the idea that i am well rounded in thinking, which include academics, logic, problem solving, emotion, and most other aspects of life. I feel like I need to use my potential and not waste it on just another normal life. At the end of the day I could just be delusional, but it constantly occurs to me that most ppl doesn't think about all the things I do (or they could be but choose to ignore or suppress etc). It doesn't really matter if I am better or am aware or all of that, the only person I can really rely on and force to do anything is myself.

It also angers me the way people around me think. Idk how the difference is this huge between my friend groups, on one hand I have friends that are mostly girls that for the most part can align with my opinions but also sometimes blindly follow whatever person has ""similar"" yet very different opinions. On the other hand I have guy friends that 70% of the time have opinions I can't stand or are completely alarming to me and it's just normal like that. 

I am talking about largely domestic issues. I can say a lot of them luckily agree about national scale issues or things that are very obviously wrong. I am afraid though that my opinions or thoughts get too radical at times but I also believe some of them have to be necessary because there's no other solution that can satisfy everything good and eliminate the bad.

This started as a reply to someone feeling like they're going crazy which I found because I wanted to find any type of solution to calm myself down and just sleep without thinking about a million things but then turned into a vent about all my thoughts. I just feel like I needed to get it out. I also am a little worried that I'm developing some sort of mental illness.

For context:
I have diagnosed bipolar II, BPD and anxiety. Yes, I‚Äôve been tested for autism (what I mention below is synonymous with behavioural traits of autism), however, whilst my sister has it, I do not. Right now I‚Äôve got my shit relatively together - I feel mentally stable and happy which is great.

However, my whole life, I‚Äôve had this innate need to be busy ALL the time. I cannot handle any sort of leisure time, vacation or meditation programs. If I stop being stressed and busy for one minute, I go absolutely mental - it drives me into a depressive phase and I get so unhappy and isolate myself. 

I think I‚Äôm addicted to stress. There is nothing I love more than being at my wits end. I need an extremely structured routine which is on an exact-time basis. I have to wake up, eat, do life and sleep at the exact same time. I like to be highly strung and tense, and I feel useless without a stressor in my life. I hate hate hate the thought of doing nothing (which is weird because so many people praise the thought of lying around in bed all day; I‚Äôd rather die). I am scared of being alone and allowed to do whatever I want at my own time‚Ä¶ I hate sick days and vacations.

I speak to this community as I am graduating soon from year 12 and I will have a large gap of structureless free time until I commence studies next February. I am not annoyed with/seeking help for my stress thing, I only want some advice for what to do with myself. I am scared.

They would be provided with some basic training in active listening, guided deep relaxation, stress reduction. They would also be ID checked and if they provide a criminal record/history certificate (eg. from FBI, Police, etc.), and they would get a verified badge.

Of course, it would not be a replacement for a doctor/therapist -- more of an additional SOS/extra source of support.

Trusted Redditors would be paid by the client, it may not be as much as a professional therapist, but certainly as much as an Uber/Doordash driver perhaps (anywhere from say $10 to $25/hr, depending on skill, experience -- up to the Redditor to decide what to charge).

1670,"I cant relax because of school pressure  Hi, I am not sure how reddit works and if I am posting this right, this also is just a throwaway account as I don't want to bother my friends and family or teachers with this, because they all think I'm fine and happy. But I  need advice how to deal with school stress. 

I am 15 years old and in my country the school system has, what you can call levels. I'm not necessarely smart, I just really live by the thought to work hard and try your hardest. For some reason when you do a higher level people expect so much more from you than they do from others. For example my brother did a level lower than me and when he got a 6 it was a miracle and worth celebrating. (Grades are 1-10, 10 being the best) However when I get a 6 for a subject I struggle with ,like math, I'd be happy and relieved. But my mom says she expected that I would only be satisfied with a higher grade. I don't really care for my grades as much, it's just that the feeling of people with authority (adults) being dissapointed in me makes me feel worthless. This isn't just with family, but also teachers. Like when I got a bad grade for a subject I normally got good grades for, my teacher expressed how dissapointed he was in me. But he only looked at one bad grade, not my other grades. My parents don't force me to study or get good grades. I'm just scared of being the dissapointment daughter. I want to get good grades so adults are proud of me, so they think I am not just some stupid kid.

When I look back at my school year, the only thing I can remeber is studying in my room for long boring hours untill it was late in the evening and I couldn't anymore. The only free time I had was about half an hour a day right before bed, in which I didn't have the energy to do any of my hobbies like drawing or baking, so I'd just end up scrolling through my phone. I haven't had any chance the whole year to do things I actually wanted to do and enjoy, so now it's my first day of the summer holidays but I just can't enjoy it and feel stuck. When I used to relax for a minute when I got home out of school, this massive pressure and guilt feeling formed in my head. Because I felt like I didn't have a right to relax as I still had homework and studying to do and It would only be gone after I thought I worked hard enough to earn my free time.¬† I just finished my testweek and I have no more work to do but that guilt feeling still exists in my brain. I don't feel relaxed enough because I am convinced it can't be over, I have made a lists of all the things I want to try and do in the holidays but I don't feel capable of doing anything because of the pressure. 

Besides this feeling I've also had trouble with sleeping since and during the testweek, I feel uneasy and just keep moving. Even though I go to bed exhausted. I've also missed my period for about three months, I suspect because of the stress. I've also become really fidgety since this year. It started with plucking my hair out, which caused it be very frizzy and uneven now. Luckily I don't do that so often anymore. Now I touch my face sometimes, mostly just scrathing my acne, which caused it become worse over the year. It helped that I started wearing more jewerly, so I can fidget with my ring or necklace instead of my hair or face. But under more extreme stress like tests the previous ones come back and I still do it now in the holidays. 

I just want to enjoy my free time before I have to go back to studying every day. Does someone know how to deal with all of this?",Relaxed
1671,"Relaxing - How do you do it?  I deal with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) which is basically non-specific (there's no locus from wench it comes), and non-sensical (anxiety about nothing in particular, not driven by a reasonably motivating event) style of anxiety. I \_think\_ I have it fairly well under control. It's definitely much better managed than it has been in the past where it was pretty crippling when it came to having a day job. With meds I'm like 98% functional.

Right now I'm struggling to relax after work. I work in a fairly high performance ""high pressure"" job. I love it. I really enjoy what I do, but it does put me in a kind of ""on edge"" mood that's difficult to shake off after the day, and I can't really seem to relax in a productive manner. Like I lack the capacity to just spend time in a way that helps make me feel refreshed. I think I also deal with guilt about being unproductive (not that I'm specifically unproductive, just any second I'm not working, I feel like I should be).

When I was younger I could just chill out and play video games forever. Now that I'm older it's much more difficult for me to get lost in video games. I also tend to not enjoy them as much if I don't have the difficulty set towards the harder end of the spectrum which can lower the capacity for playing the game being ""relaxing"". Since video games used to be one of the core ways I relaxed when I was younger, and I don't have access to that anymore, I was curious what people do to relax?

Do you do any specific activities?

Do you specifically try to relax, like through meditation?

I tend to find watching some media enjoyable, but most of it I don't find engrossing enough to pay attention to 100%. So I'll often be playing a game and talking with people online while watching a tv segment. This doesn't work with all media as some of it really requires you to know what the characters are doing on screen, but if it's something like This Week Tonight with John Oliver it's basically a podcast with some relevant visuals so I can just listen to it and enjoy it.

I'm 29 and I have great difficulty relaxing

Relaxing is benefacial to the human mind and body, by allowing yourself to recover you can do work more efficiently, have more energy to exercise and learn, do hobbies and chores, to foster relationships, and more. Machines even new to relax and chill a bit to avoid overheating or to have time to oil up or change new parts.

If I know all of this, why can't I allow myself to relax? I need to, but I cannot. Whenever I try to go on a walk, or watch a movie, or play a game, my brain makes me want to do chores that are non existent or I feel guilty for not doing my side hustle work or learning stuff.

For context I'm in some debt, but have a stable job that should be able to pay it off by perhaps end of 2023 or mid 2024. I also do some side hustles on my own schedule. I also stress eat and feel like ""I have not accomplished enough"" before I turn 30 next year. I think these occupy my mind a lot and prevent me from relaxing.

It has made me even more obsessive with keeping a clean home than I was before this. Even growing up my grandma would make comments about how I'm in a cleaning mood and she will leave me alone for a bit while I'm busy. lol. So of course when I come home after a long day, I want my house to be SPOTLESS. We'll start by saying that my bf and I live in a small 1bd/1ba apartment, like 600sqft, so that alone is enough to drive someone crazy. I want everything in it's place, no clutter (my bf and I are working together on this. It's not THAT bad, I'm just crazy. A lot of the clutter is hidden in chests, closets, under my buffet, kitchen cabinets, ect), sink always clean of dishes, all wet surfaces no water stains, floors always swept/mopped (we have no pets or kids, I don't wear shoes in house but for SOME REASON, our floors are always so nasty) laundry put away/no dirty laundry. I'm really good with putting things back but my bf drives me up a wall. I'll clean and organize his stuff and without fail 3 days later, he'll lose something and shred up everything and never put it back. On top of his usual pile of junk that ends up on the kitchen counter and clothes piled up. We don't have a washer and dryer so it makes me even more insane because I have to dedicate HOURS at the laundromat during what's supposed to be my free time. 

BASICALLY, I feel like I can NEVER relax. Literally every waking second of my day is spent stressed about some part of my house and how it's not where I want it to be. I don't want to do anything on my days off except for try to catch up what I couldn't do during the week/spend hours at laundromat or families house doing laundry. Until everything is up to spec, I don't want to leave and can't concentrate on anything. My bf tries to get me to relax and drink or do the freaky but I just don't even want to do any of that because all I can think about is the laundry piles or dirty dishes, or some other misc bs like my dirty grout.

1689,"How can I ""relax"" and ""not over think"" while still self prompting and critical thinking enough to understand my enviroment and get tasks done?  Whenever I ""relax"" , ""let go"", or calm down so does my accuracy level about everything. I stop being able to predict problems and get things done in those moments, as well as when I am calm I am unprepared for any problems or stress (because that takes prompting myself to conceptualize the things before they happen and holding on to that concept mentally, so no longer relaxed) so the impact of failing/being hit with a sensory problem/being brought to my attention that I am not self monitoring my body language or vocal volume(pitch, inflection, tone)/ or things of that matter hurt me at critical levels because I am vunerable and I have deep emotional reactions.

Knowing that death is permanent and we have this pocket to exhist with keeps me motivated to go to work because I understand I live on a rock with other humans who have built systems to survive within (agreeable or disagreeable as the systems can be) is the framework that I maintain employment. The other thing is emulating sets of behaviors to express/demonstrate a particular communication or function to others. These concepts press me into doing what I must (don't get me wrong I still enjoy myself, pressured on top of it) and executing but are stressful and I can't conceptualize waking upon a workday ""calm"" or ""not overthinking"" because I wouldn't understand the importance at my core without the extra thinking (the ""because chain"" I call it. Its like DLC in my brain and not always accessible or can be turned off)

I think I am also asking how do people operate  without the ""because chain"" like what stops them from doing the thing they understand they shouldn't or should without actively thinking about it. Also how can I ""let go"" of burdening conceptualizations of the world and chronically stress me out but still have them and still be as accurate as possible and be guarded with my guard down?

When we have anxiety or stress in our life, one of the ways our body responds is with muscle tension. Progressive muscle relaxation is a method that helps relieve that tension. In progressive muscle relaxation, you tense a group of muscles as you breathe in, and you relax them as you breathe out. I've found it to be very useful...

I started trying out relaxation methods: mostly deeper breaths and squeezing and relaxing muscles before sleep. Also, I'm making meditation my new daily habit. Usually these techniques work. I am not expecting them to make me feel relaxed after a week of training but I am very positive about the outcome that they might bring in the near future. However, the problem is that they work when I am left alone and I can try them when I am sure noone is close. They are basically useless when it comes to managing tension in my body when close with friends.

So my question is, do you have any good exercises/techniques/whatever that I can use when being with my friends so I will relax just a little bit? Or when being in work in one office with seven people?

I decided that I don't want to live like that anymore. To just look when my friends eat because whenever I eat anything it makes me feel discomfort. I want to be able to speak, be able to speak for myself and be able to speak easily and confidently, and right now I feel like I am blocked.

1703,"I can't relax  I'm asking for some advice because this is pretty heavy: does any of you get the feeling that you just HAVE to do something, all the time, and even when you do, you feel frustrated and like you're wasting your time?

I firmly believe that life should be taken slowly and calmly, in theory, but in practice, I'm the opposite. I'm impatient, and I always think I'm not doing enough, or I should be doing something else, or that whatever I'm doing has to be done QUICKLY. 
When I am relaxing, I never manage to really relax. 
I end up feeling constantly tired, and that means that when I do stuff, anything, like school or gym or whatever, I feel tired, but I don't want to. I want to do these things. 

I'm also facing the ""issue"" in therapy and it seems like I push myself too much, which is probably true, but my parents always thought you should just DO a lot of stuff, and letting it go will be most likely pretty hard.

1704,Relaxing methods for quarantine  Do you have any advices how to reduce stress? Since last few weeks I feel very uptight and I can't feel relaxed. It is probably due to isolation (I don't really think about how many people got sick or died and I would say that is doesn't bother me that much) but I feel that if I won't do anything about that I am gonna freak out eventually - I would say that I feel kind of uncomfortable rn. I think it might help others as well,Relaxed

I cant relax on the couch bc what if its on there or the ceiling and falls down on me?





I cant lay back down bc what if its in my blanket or gets on me while i sleep,



what if its already laid eggs and found some unreachable crevice to nest in?



Ive now been up for a solid hour, tired on 3hrs of sleep, and have literally only been googling pest repellants and hunched over on my couch, moving only periodically to check if a bug has shown up near me.




Ive been like this as long as i can remember, every spring and summer i worry, and maybe forget if i go long enough without seeing one. Then it happens again and no bueno.",Relaxed

1709,"Stress: Hyperfocus on vision and trouble relaxing eyes?  I'll preface this by stating that I am already in the process of getting professional help. However, the wait's long. That's why I joined this community - Google didn't help me out with the following.  

I'm a Master's student in times of Corona. I'm sat primarily at home and I've always been a worrying person, but it's gone through the roof now that I see very few people. My main issue right now, and what's actually interfering with my work, is that I'm hyperfocussing on my vision. It sounds weird, and I'll try to explain it as well as possible:

When I look at a display, I may see something in my periphery. Maybe a door, maybe a cupboard... Can be anything my brain focusses on. And it's not as if it's not there - those objects are really there. The issue then is that I'm then trying to focus on those objects in my periphery. Do I still see them well? Are they darker than they should be? This focus on everything in my periphery then makes it very difficult to focus on the display itself, which is extraordinarily tiring. This also holds for books and puzzles etc. I'm also constantly opening and closing my eyelids slightly, because I perpetually see my eyelashes. Since October last year I have glasses, so I suppose my vision is actually changing slightly...  Another annoying this is that when I quickly turn my head, I see for a very brief moment a distortion in my vision. That happens when my eyes get thrown to the side and then of course slightly deform. But seeing that little distorted circle in my vision is enough to Falcon 9 my heart rate through the roof and destroy any form of energy and positivity I had for that day.

Now the last one is the most influential one: I seem to have some difficulties relaxing my eyes. When I go to sleep, this results in the fact that my eyes are still relatively active and will not relax. The process of relaxing them makes them somewhat jolty, as I'm trying to de-accomodate my eyes myself instead of letting that happen automatically. And that is when I \_think\_ I see some flashes. And that scares me a lot. I don't see any flashes during the day. Nor do I objectively see anything black in my vision during the day - subjectively I keep checking my vision whether there is anything odd or wrong. These flashes before I go to sleep scare me shitless and make my heart rate go through the roof as well. Which then influences my sleep dramatically.

I guess my question is: Do more people suffer from these restless eyes? Is there anyone with some tips or tricks? And before you ask: Yeah, I'm pretty stressed out. My life is kind-of centred around university, and I don't really have any hobbies left. Any advice and/or tips would be greatly appreciated. Country: NL.",Relaxed
1710,"Why is the medazepan not working? I took it to relax and all I want is to run out of my body and escape  
People who take anti anxiety meds, I don't have anxiety but I was allowed to take relaxers in the past because I got nervous for tests.

I took a double dose of medazepan because I thought it would help me nap for the rest of the day after a workout, by instead I'm jumpy, and agitated so much so I punched a wall to bruise my knuckles.

My legs feel a little unstable but my mind feels normal, and I feel peppy and miserable at the same time.

I wanted to dope myself silly so I wouldn't have to do anything else and now I just feel shaky inside and yet I hold my hands out in front of me and I'm not shaking. I feel like screaming but I can't.

After several therapy sessions and a lot of reading online I stumbles on a guide claiming that mantra repetition help a lot in focusing wandering mind. So I on my way communing to work I remmembered the Close encounters of the third kind chant. I tried clearing my thoughts and focused on that. Music always helped me daydream so it sounded like a good advice. After a few moments my entire body relaxed. It was like getting an orgasm. A wave traveling through your body.

I don't often feel like I get a lot of time to relax and do stuff I enjoy; when I do I ""like"" video games, but when I get time to play something I want, it fails to hold my attention, or I get frustrated or bored quickly and give up and just end up mindlessly scrolling through social media again. I also struggle to gain much traction with books. I don't draw any comfort from tv shows that I've watched over and over.",Relaxed
1713,"Good relaxation and stress relief at home  What can be done to quickly relieve stress and tension? This method works well for me, but for obvious reasons only in home office or after work in free time. You need a quiet room and a gym ball (60 cm or 23 inches as a minimum). Just sit on it and then slowly put your back on the ball, so that you finally hang upside down on the ball. The arms are stretched out to the side and are in the air. The back is stretched out in a comfortable way to follow the curve of the ball, the head is also on the ball, the legs stay on the ground and provide balance. And then just move back and forth, maybe close your eyes. Relaxation occurs very quickly, the back muscles are pleasantly relieved and relaxed, the head is well supplied with blood. This works very well for me and I am then quickly recovered and motivated.",Relaxed
1714,How to relax my germaphobia?  I'm seeing a therapist but she said i need to see a psychologist to get my issues fixed. I dont see them til Thursday and since i feel like most likely they want to put me on something instead of steps to fixing this mentally. I feel like i can mentally beat this but i just dont know how. I feel very trapped in a loop constantly washing my hand for like 30 min sometimes.

1718,"I got high with a group of friends on NYE and instead of feeling chill and relaxed, it felt as though I'd entered a movie and my friends were all actors playing a part.  So, this has never happened to me before. I know weed can alter your mental state and be a poor choice for people with mental issues but I never really suffered from anything that detrimental. 

This time, I completely separated from reality and it felt as though the people around me were playing rehearsed parts. I should also state that I'd only met some of these people once before, others never and had only one close friend there who was the one that invited me. They were having conversations that, in my mind, were about me but not in a direct sense. They never spoke my name or directly to me but it felt as though every conversation was a thinly veiled jab at my personality. It was as though they were trying to ruin me and tear down every aspect of myself. It changed slowly but divulged into me sitting there thinking these guys had rehearsed dialogue and that this was a game they played to mess with people that were brought into the group. 

 This experience was extremely damaging to my mind and I won't be doing weed for a long time, but I just don't know what actually happened. This whole experience just made me feel absolutely insane and question my whole goddamn life.

Said she feels like she's going to die. She doesn't look great, almost like she's sick, but she says she isn't sick except for feeling like she's going to die. Her pulse is normal.

I had her take a shower, brushed her hair and she put on her jammies. Tucked her bed with beach sounds and told her to relax and picture being at the beach. Walked in a couple of minutes later and she's crying.

I'm really worried but completely clueless. My husband thinks it's her ADHD/Adderall, but this has never happened before. She has been very moody and temperamental lately. Can anybody clue me in on possibly causes or where to start?",Relaxed

1722,"Does anyone else get physical pain/headaches/flair-ups when they transition from being SUPER stressed to relaxed?  So I am in this year-long software development program and I graduate in literally 13 days. I was extremely stressed because I could write a NOVEL about the trauma I've been through before this program (PTSD, anxiety, and OCD as a result of an extremely abusive upbringing where my mother almost tried to kill me, and years of homelessness from 17 to 20), but since getting in, my life has been getting much better. The program is a year long, but they've gotten me REALLY good insurance, and I've also been given an educational stipend the entire time, so I haven't had to work while I study.


The thing is that as soon as we graduate, that stipend stops. And I've been in a PANIC. I remember being on and off jobless for two years, having it kill my relationship and destroy my mental health. The thought of being on the job search again after graduation has been tearing me apart. My school does 4 months of job placement assistance, but I would have to survive off of a very meager savings. I have literally developed an involuntery twitch in my right eye, and on and off headaches. I've gained a little weight because I'm stress eating (this has never happened before -- Yay!), and it's just been an all around bad time...


Until someone on LinkedIn contacted me yesterday about an interview.


And not just ANY interview -- they're trying to fast-track me and have me employed to start a day after my graduation. It's a company my school is partnered with and they need someone FAST. They're even skipping a technical interview. It's all amazing news, and having grown up SUPER poor, the amount of money still kind of has me in shock. **The thing is, every time I go from having an unbelievable amount of stress to very little or none, my body experiences pain...** I'm not sure if this is because I'm physically unclenching? Like my shoulders are USUALLY seized up or tense most of the time. It's like my default state. But today, I feel completely and totally relaxed because my job search and 22-year-struggle is about to be over, and yet my pains are getting a bit worse. The last time something like this happened, my body needed to sleep for 12 hours a day for a good 5 days or so before I got used to being relaxed. I'm going to set a doctor's appointment (I'm constantly having to remind myself I have insurance now!) as soon as possible, but does anyone else experience this?",Relaxed
1723,"Been triggered, and now I can't relax or sleep well  Got family stuff going on, and a member of the family came in and out of the living room in the last 3-4 days, shouting threats, accusations, and crummy judgements. I'm so triggered, and I can't relax, and when I sleep it's like I sleep dream about every detail of it, and it's all in my head when I wake up, too.   


I have a headache from it, I'm tense all over, and I can't seem to do self care very well, or feel other emotions much. I have gotten some laughs from some really funny stuff on imgur, but there's so few truly funny things on there with COVID, and the political stuff, even a video of a husky refusing to go inside got people all upset in the comments. I just want to switch off this defensive, irritated mode I'm in, but the whole world feels like it's triggered.   


I would have shared this one crazy funny video of this guy dancing to the Rasputin song on Facebook, but all my family on there think my sense of humor is whack, so that wouldn't have helped.   


It's triggering me feeling like I don't want to be alive over and over, but I don't really want to do that, or think that. I have family that it would hurt very seriously, and it damn sure wouldn't help things. It just feels like the only way I can hope to stop the agony of this episode I'm having.

But the last few weeks, I've noticed that I had a hard time focusing. I thought it would pass after my week of vacation which I had planned to spend with my uncle, but because of some other family matters, I spent it with my grandparents, which is pretty much not what I wanted.  
After spending a week in the elderly version of Groundhog Day, my concentration got worse, I'm easy to anger, I get frustrated about anything, I need to force myself to do exercices or go to class. When I talk to my teachers about this, they tell me to call the university psychiatrist, but the earliest spot on her calendar is end of april.  
I also learned that the Erasmus program (student exchange with other countries) put me on the first semester next year instead of the second, so now I also have to deal with all of that administrative stuff they told me I could do because I wanted the second semester.

1727,"Those of you that work a 9-5, do you just go home and relax after work or do you go out and do things (and if so, HOW DO YOU HAVE THE ENERGY!? lol)  So I worked for myself/from home for over a decade and now I'm like a year into a 9-5. Actually it's 8:30pm - 4:30pm (but with an hour and some change of commute both ways).I have to get ready for work around 6:30am/6:45am, so most mornings I wake around 5 or 530am, so that I could have some me time. Meditate, journal, make a coffee, and sit on the couch and read; before having to get ready for work. I REALLY appreciate this slow, relaxing me time in the morning.

  
But waking up at 5:00am(ish), I normally go to bed by 9pm. I get home from work around 6pm(ish). So really, it only gives me like 3 hours of free time in the evenings. But also, after 8 hours at work and my hour or so commute home I AM EXHAUSTED. I don't do much in the evenings; other than relax. Which of course is nice. But also it has me feeling like I'm only REALLY living life on the weekends.

  
I would be willing to sacrifice some sleep. I like to get around 8 hours. But my non-negotiable is 7 hours. I am also willing to sacrifice my hour-90 min slow morning routine some mornings, so that I could have a life after work. I would like to wake up no later than 6:15am though. So realistically I COULD go to sleep as late as 11:00pm. Although most things I'd be interested in doing week nights would be over before 10pm realistically (going to see a movie, getting a bite with a friend, going to catch some live jazz, going to an AA meeting, etc). But I'm still just SO EXHAUSTED after that 8 hour work day and hour + bus ride home. I couldn't imagine going to a 7pm movie or hitting an 8:00pm AA meeting (I'm sober) or going to see live jazz til 10pm.

What's the trick here? How often do you go out and do stuff on week-nights? How do you have the energy? Any tips or advice?

I really want to support her but it's so difficult, on top of the fact that I have my own things going on and I also then feel really guilty that I hate helping her because it makes me feel selfish. She has other people who support her which is great but unfortunately she lives in a verbally abusive household which due to weird laws, she can't currently get out of, without telling said abusive parents.

1738,"How to relax without feeling guilty?  I feel guilty every single time I try to wind down and enjoy some personal time. I feel like I‚Äôm putting my career on hold if I do so.

For reference, I‚Äôm a personal trainer currently. My income is based on my clientele. I do work 25-35 front desk hours weekly so that‚Äôs steady pay, but it‚Äôs not for much at all. Most days involve me waking up at 4:00 am and working front desk until 10. Afterwards I usually train 2-3 clients until 11. I then head home and take a quick nap, then head back to the gym at 2:30ish for a workout. 4:00-5:30ish is spent prospecting on the gym floor. 5:30-7:45 is training more clients. 7:45-8:30 is more prospecting. I usually leave the gym about 9, go home and get to bed as quick as possible. I‚Äôm usually in bed by 11 or so after taking some time to quiet my mind. Get back at up at 4, rinse and repeat M-F. Saturday I usually have 1-2 clients then work front desk for about 6 hours. Sundays I try to relax but feel guilty after a few hours of relaxing when I feel like I could be out doing more marketing for myself and what not.

I understand this is a quick road to burnout, but I can‚Äôt seem to turn it off. Anytime I try to relax, I feel like I‚Äôm selling myself short.

EDIT: I spend so much time prospecting and at the gym in general because I was told that‚Äôs the quickest way to climb the ranks.

Now I did apparently get my lesson, as so far I have been keeping up rather good. Now the opposite issue strikes though. We usually get bigger amounts of work at once to schedule for ourselves, which ends up meaning that I cannot calm down at the end of the day, as I see the work scheduled for tommorow, and think ""I should do some of it now, what if I need more time for the last bits?""

1745,"I (22F) recently cut chords with a toxic friend (22F) and my body won't let me relax since  I've recently cut chords with an ex friend. She simply wasn't someone I saw in my future and I put it plain and simple. She does a lot of drugs and did them around me and I don't want to be associated with that, she started copying everything I do to a strange extent (buying the same clothes as me after she saw me in them, copying my instagram captions word for word, even started collecting a plushie brand which I have been collecting for a few years, etc), she didn't respect my privacy and she did things to make me believe she's interested in my boyfriend.

My boyfriend shares an apartment with her and one other person as I told her that there was a room available there when she was looking for a place and she took it, this was when I got along with her and honestly before I knew her very well.

I started distancing myself as what she was doing was making me uncomfortable. I stopped seeing my boyfriend where he stays because her living there made me uncomfortable. She didn't get in direct contact with me either, so I was hoping the friendship would just naturally fade away and that nothing had to be really said.

However, my bf unfriended her on facebook (had nothing to do with me, completely his choice) and she messaged me basically telling on my boyfriend to me. Saying he unfriended her on facebook, that he won't hang out with them when they have people over and basically just shitted on my boyfriend to me. My boyfriend isn't my responsibility, and I figured that if she had a problem with him she should say it to him. I'm not his parent. So I didn't justify it with a response, and she deleted it after a day anyway.

A few days later I met with my best friend and I posted a picture of us on my snapchat story. After I did this I got a message this girl saying I didn't respond to her on messenger, she basically told on my boyfriend to me again and was saying that I should be inviting her to things (implying I should have invited her to my get together with my closest friend which she doesn't even really know) even though that was the first time I've been properly out in a few months because I'm working on a dissertation, and other things like that. I responded this time saying that my boyfriend isn't my responsibility, that I haven't been out in months and I don't think I should have to answer to hanging out with my best friend on my own.

She replied that she was in work and would respond later. In the meantime I had a think about it and said that I don't appreciate the things she is doing, but I hold no grudge against her and I said to her that I don't think we click anymore and that I'm not going to waste her time, but I wish her the best.

She responded with a big thing about how awful me and my boyfriend are but I didn't respond to that and just said that I was honest and I'm not going to argue further, and I said again that I wish her the best. I just wanted to make it clear that I was putting a stop to or friendship. I hated the things she did to me and how she made me feel, but I wanted to be mature about how I ended it, so I was honest but civil.

She didn't reply to me after that, but she messaged my boyfriend that she bets he's delighted I won't talk to her anymore. I still have some things at the apartment in my boyfriends room that I have to go back and get, and I am going to have college classes with her next semester, so I'm still going to see her and I think that might be a reason to why I'm feeling like this.

In my head I know I did the right thing and that it needed to be clear that I wanted it to end, but it's been three days now and I have so much tightness in my body around my chest and sides. I'm having trouble sleeping and I can't relax. In my mind I think I feel fine about everything, but my body is tight and uncomfortable and I've been getting bad pains in my side. 

I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this feeling and what's the best way to help with it? I want to be able to forget about it and relax but my body won't let me. Any advice is appreciated!

1748,"Racing thoughts, intense focus and not able to relax  Hi!

I have diagnosed anxiety, depression and I score high on several of the criteria for autism spectrum disorder (Asperger‚Äôs), but not all of them. I‚Äôm in grad school, where I perform well. 

I have some very heavy issues at the moment however. Whatever I do or get interested in, I spend so much effort and energy on it that it harms my mental health, and I‚Äôm not able to do anything else. 

Take, for instance, school. I feel I always HAVE to read and study more than everyone else, and perform better than them. If I don‚Äôt get an A+ or at least an A, I feel like a failure. This has some negative consequences - I stay up all night to work on essays, and around the days when grades are due I can‚Äôt do anything except for checking every 10 mins if it‚Äôs arrived or not. I‚Äôm totally unable to do anything else.

Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not only school that impacts me this way. Take, for instance, last fall. I came across a series of news articles about a young guy who 15 years ago went missing after a party in a nearby county. After huge searches and a police investigation suspecting foul play, he was found dead a month later, drowned, downstream in a river. 

I found the case fascinating, I read all about it that I could find, I even went to the place where the party was, I drove the exact route he probably walked to the place believed he fell in the river, and I went to the place he was found. I tracked down the guy‚Äôs family and friends he was with that day on social media, people he had argued with at the party, etc. I then made the conclusion that the guy had been murdered - the latter folks had gone to look for him after he left the party to walk home, caught up with him by the river, they started arguing and they pushed this drunk teen into the cold river.

It all made sense to me - I really believed I had solved a murder case, and I considered contacting the local police. I didn‚Äôt, and after a while, my interest in the case dwindled after a very intense month or so. During this month, I was rarely in school, and when I was, I‚Äôd be sitting on my computer researching this case.

Another, more ¬´stable¬ª, yet intense, interest of mine is soccer. And by that I don‚Äôt mean only following a team in the MLS and a team in the Premier League. I know the names of just about every team in college soccer, and in the top 4 divisions in England and Italy. I can spend a day looking through the internet for videos of match highlights from Serie D (the 4th level in Italy), that get about 150 views each. 

Lately, I‚Äôve developed a fear of flying and an (unwilling) interest in plane crashes and flight safety. I keep reading through accident investigation reports from all corners of the world, and I scour the internet to find out what changes that have been done to the planes and pilot training after major accidents.

I‚Äôm awful at putting things aside and going to sleep, and when I finally get in bed, my thoughts keep racing, preventing me from falling to sleep. I‚Äôll wake up either early (like today) or late, but never energized and rested. 

My intense focus on important and unimportant stuff makes me skip stuff that needs to be done - cleaning my apartment, changing bedsheets, taking out the trash. I know it should be done, but I procrastinate, because I can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt want to think about it.

All of this makes me a very stressed person. I never relax, I always have millions of thoughts racing through my head. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not able to filter out stuff and say to myself ¬´you don‚Äôt have to think more about this¬ª until I feel I‚Äôm through everything there is to read and say about the topic. 

As you can imagine, I tend to do well at trivia nights, and I get good grades in school, but that‚Äôs about all that is positive about this. It stresses me out, and it ruins my mental health. I feel like I‚Äôm about to hit a giant wall where I at best won‚Äôt be able to do anything else than stay in bed, or at worst develop schizophrenia or another form of paranoia.

I have seen a psychologist/therapist and received cognitive therapy, but I feel it hasn‚Äôt had any effect, so I stopped it. Wasn‚Äôt worth paying for.

1753,"How to relax and relieve stress?  So Ive suffered from depression and anxiety issues my entire life. Frankly while it's rarely a serious risk that ill actually go through with it I contemplate suicide on a daily basis.

While it's certainly not the only reason Ive come to the conclusion that a big part of the anxiety in my life is due to an inability to deal with stress in a healthy way. Whenever there's some of kind major fear or concern in my life it eats me apart every day until it's either resolved or I go through multiple mental breakdowns and eventually get to the point where I'm too exhausted to care for a while.

I know this isn't how most people deal with stress but I just don't know any other way. A thought like ""My life is going nowhere and I'm probably gonna end up homeless"" or ""My fragile lifestyle is falling apart"" just eats me apart and often drives me to a point where I can't function as a normal human being which usually just compounds the problem and increases my stress levels.",Relaxed

I‚Äôm currently enrolled in two college-level classes, along with the rest of my regular high school classes.  I have multiple responsibilities at home.  I have ADHD and GAD, which makes it very hard to relax as well.

My issue is that when I do have the time to relax, I become sad due to the feeling that I am not useful or that I do not serve a purpose.  I have become so used to being mentally and physically occupied for hours straight every day, that when I relax or take time for myself I subconsciously view it as laziness (even though I logically know I deserve it, and relaxation is needed).  I want to relax and be happy, but how in the world do I even do that anymore?  This has gotten so bad to the point that I will neglect eating sometimes during lunch in order to complete homework assignments.  

I think this has majorly to due with my overbearing parents, who expect me to have A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs along with fulfilling multiple responsibilities that I have at home.  If I don‚Äôt do them or forget, my mother emotionally manipulated me into feeling bad.

I discovered this oddly enough by playing a video game called gmod. There was a lobby with a piano that people would play with the keyboard and even just being online with someone listening to them play a digital keyboard really relaxed me. So since then, the only time I've ever been able to replicate this feeling is by listening to a friend play piano in real life, or listening to someone in real time play piano in a video game?

My plan is to have my desk in a corner of the room and use it pretty much exclusively for work, otherwise I'd just use my laptop and lazyboy. I could also get a room divider and/ or a murphy bed to make it feel like a different space when working.

Is it true that your office should not be in your bedroom? Or are there other ways to separate work and relaxation in the same room?",Relaxed

1818,"Tips for more mental and inner peace in your life  Life can get pretty hectic, and it's essential to take some time for ourselves to find inner peace. Here are some simple and respectful tips to incorporate more mental calmness into your daily routine:  
  
Breathing Mindfully: Focus on your breathing for a few minutes each day. Inhale slowly, feel the air filling your lungs, and exhale gently. This easy exercise can help you become more aware of the present moment and relax your nervous system.  
  
Embrace Nature: Spend time outdoors, whether it's a short walk in the park or just sitting in your backyard. Connecting with nature has a soothing effect on the mind and can provide a much-needed break from daily stressors.  
  
Gratitude Journaling: Reflect on the positive aspects of your life by keeping a gratitude journal. Every day, make a list of three things for which you are grateful. You may change your attention from what is going wrong to what is going right.  
  
Digital Detox: Switch off from social media and screens. Set aside dedicated time each day to unplug and engage in activities that bring you joy without the constant digital distractions.  
  
Mindful Eating: Be aware of what you are eating. Chew slowly, savor each bite, and appreciate the flavors. This mindful approach not only enhances your eating experience but also promotes a sense of calmness.  
  
Practice Acceptance: Understand that not everything is within your control. Acceptance of the present moment, even if it's challenging, can alleviate unnecessary stress. Let go of the things you cannot change and concentrate on the things you can.  
  
Prioritize Sleep: Ensure you're getting enough quality sleep. A rested mind is more capable of managing everyday obstacles and makes a substantial contribution to mental health in general.  
Connect with Loved Ones: Sharing your thoughts and feelings with others can provide support and strengthen your sense of connection, fostering a more peaceful state of mind.  
  
Remember, these are just suggestions, and everyone's journey to inner peace is unique. Feel free to share your own tips or experiences, and let's create a positive and supportive space for one another. I wish you all a peaceful and fulfilling day!

1820,"How do I find inner peace?  For contex I, M(16), have an abnormally fast heart rate and I have been experiencing uncharacteristically intense chest and heart pains for the last 2 years of my life and I was just recently told that something is over working my heart and if I continue to ‚Äúover work‚Äù my heart I might not have much longer to live considering I have already had 2 ‚Äúheart attacks‚Äù (I use the term heart attack because symptoms included, left side freezing up, intense chest pain, light headedness, and then I black out. Doctors said they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me)

The medical professional who just told me about the possibilities of me having a premature death, told me that it could be related to some sort of emotional pain, ie stress, anxiety, depression. He said he noticed that I am at war with myself internally and that it looks like I have a ‚Äúwall‚Äù built up protecting me from something and that I need to find inner peace with myself by coming to terms with it and ‚Äúsmashing‚Äù the wall down. 

The weird part about it is that I never feel stressed so I was quick to rule out the possibility of stress being my issue. But as I got to thinking I noticed the wall built up in my mind that he mentioned. For some reason I don‚Äôt remember much from before my first ‚Äúheat attack thing‚Äù and the more I thought about it and the more I tried to tear down the wall the more my chest and heat hurt and the more infuriated I became.

I do know that when I had my first ‚Äúheart attack thing‚Äù I was in a toxic relationship and my gf at the time was yelling at me about something and then I had the intense chest pains, and then I blacked out. It is because of this relationship that I haven‚Äôt dated much sense. Also currently I am taking 4 AP classes and trying to maintain my 4.0. I don‚Äôt know if any of  that is I mportant to anything but it‚Äôs worth mentioning.

TLDR 
I have had chest and heart pains that cause my left side to go really numb and it causes me to black out for several minutes and doctors don‚Äôt know what to do other than trying to help me find what I‚Äôm at war with internally and if I can‚Äôt find out what‚Äôs wrong I could be dead in about a decade because I‚Äôm overworking my heart.

1822,"The secret ingredient to unlocking peace  Concentration, from a Buddhist perspective, means keeping your awareness steadily focused on a single object such as the body or a tree for a period of time. This is not something comes very naturally to us, but teaching ourselves how to concentrate is critical for living a happy life. It was so important the Buddha made it one of the eightfold noble path.

But isn‚Äôt mindfulness and concentration the same thing? They are similar and there is overlap, but where mindfulness is an awareness of our current experience wherever that might take us - our breath, our body, our mind, the external environment - concentration is taking a single object of awareness and focusing exclusively on that. This is also called single pointed awareness and it can be very powerful. 

You might look at mindfulness and concentration as the difference between a light bulb and a laser. We can light up the present moment with mindful awareness just like the light bulb brightens a room. But we can penetrate an object deeply using the focus of a laser. Both emit light but are applied very differently. 

That's why concentration is the secret ingredient of powerful awareness and unlocking peace. Building up our ability to concentrate has many benefits - applied to our breath it can bring calmness in our body. Applied to how we‚Äôre feeling it can reveal huge insights into our suffering. Concentration allows us to reduce our stress, find answers to our problems rather than ruminating on them and become more disciplined in our everyday life.

1824,"How to find inner peace with health anxiety?  Hi everyone,

27 male, highly sensitive personality here

For the last 3 years my life has been up and down. I will try to describe my problem, I would appreciate your time spent there.


I started experiencing pelvic problems, spasms so started looking for diagnosis. Spent thousands on various terribly stressful appointments and tests.

They found disc herniation in my spine - as I guess nothing else they found disturbing, the doctors said it should be the cause of my symptoms and they scare me with surgery.

The point is, with each and every doc the opinion is different and I take it all emotionally. It devastes me, nevertheless, a few PTs and docs said that it is not the reason of my problem. Still, I have that suspicious approach (what if all of them are wrong and I can't be calm about it?). 

And to be honest, I am really scared of hospitals and surgeries done there. Especially, when they say that it will help for a few years and then ""you will be left in agonal pain"" - said by one doc without any emotions...

This year with some new symptoms, I found myself in terrible for me state - woke up after some 20 minutes with strong feeling that something is happening with me and panic attack as I was feeling of losing connection with myself or about to go mad. (Now I read it must have been anxiety and derealisation)

I go to PT and try to change my lifestyle to feel better but mentally I think I am worse. Every day I fight with lack of sense, strong beliefs that I have to be ""ready"" because I might find myself in hospital next minute/day/hour etc. 

My wife tries to support me but I feel like a burden as she also becomes a bit depressed by my attitude.  

Sometimes I try to not think about future but with some (new/appearing) symptom (e.g. burning sensation in leg) I start analysing, googling symptoms and I always expect the worst.

I invested in a few (expensive) meetings with psychologist but she did not really help me - for me everything comes to pretending that I do not care about problems/situations which can appear in the future.

I feel like I need to do something as that whole situation drains me mentally, jumping from ""I forgot about the results of MRI so I feel happy"" to ""they found something so surely I will undergo surgery and terrible pain in the future"".

Maybe you will drop here some ideas how to overcome it?",Relaxed

When I just began 1st grade, I would get my ass kicked by some older kids and had to go through a fucking sexual assault day by day (I had all of that as a repressed memories, thanks alot brain for making me remember them when I was feeling depressed and bed ridden)

I was outcasted all the time by others and didn't had exactly great friends and they were usually confused or pissed off about me and would sometimes even be left alone by them, so I felt lonely all the time

I was humiliated by the teachers Infront of the class (other kids too, but me being the most, cause I was really just considered as that deranged stupid kid) and once even had a mental breakdown infront of my mother, which is what led me to switch schools since the beginning of 7 grade
And oh boy, my life then changed for a better, I think

I switched to a private school and everything was so chill and nice, the teachers were really calm and kind, the kids too, none of them were some jackasses

Like yeah it was nice and all, but it all felt so fake and weird, like why isn't anyone kicking my ass and or humiliating me? Like did I get so used to this type of shit, to the point I can't even accept the peace and the kindness?? 
I kind of hate it, I don't know, feels abit gross too

Copy/pasting the post:

&#x200B;

On paper, I have a great life. I am a computer engineer with an MBA degree and currently working in tech making 6 figures. I am living the American dream of the white picket fence, with a loving husband and 2 adorable kids, aged 5 and 7. I will be turning 40 soon. We have quite a bit of savings and recently also bought a 4 bedroom 3000 sqft house. Err, this is probably coming off as a humblebrag so far, but I will get to my problem next.

&#x200B;

All my life I have never cared. In school, I kept hearing the phrase ""smart but lazy"" from teachers. It's like the part of the brain involved in deciding what to prioritize in life never kicked off for me. The only thing that would  make me study is last-minute panic. I would get a passing grade with what little I studied and then will tell myself that I will do better next time. I remember giving  motivational speeches to myself since the age  of 10, but it never works. I end up doing the same thing the next time. Over time, I started hating myself for what I am doing with my  life  and started developing a very ""who cares? I am going to die one day. Even if I become the President of a Country, does it matter?"" attitude. That attitude shaped my life. In school, I had a few friends, but I did a terrible job of staying in touch with them. Recently I came to know that there is a huge WhatsApp group with all my school friends, which I am not a part of. I have never been able to make long lasting friends. It's like, even if I like someone enough to be friends with them, the act of making plans with them and socializing with them is something overwhelming. The only time I will hang out with them is if they make plans. Even those plans, I will sometimes come up with excuses and bail on them. Pretty soon, they will stop making plans with me. This has been the theme all through my life. In school, in college, in grad school, and now at work and with my next door neighbors.

&#x200B;

The only reason I studied computer engineering was because I come from a family of engineers and didn't know what else to do with my life. My parents pushed me down the same path (This is not a complaint against them. They did the best they could. If I had pushed back, they would have listened). 

&#x200B;

After engineering, I was a software engineer for  a few years, decided I absolutely hated it and moved to USA to do my  MBA. I have since made a home here.Now, like I mentioned earlier, on paper, I have a successful tech career. The problem is I have always hated my job and never cared enough to do my job well. I keep jumping jobs every 2 years (in tech, a lot of people jump jobs, so no one bats an eyelid at why I have worked at 6 different places in the last 10  years). I do great in interviews, because theoretically I know how to do my job well. I end up getting a great offer. After I join the new job, I immediately start hating it and do the bare minimum I need  to do in order to not get fired. I have had multiple meetings with multiple managers over the years. The managers get very confused after I actually start working. ""Is this the same woman who interviewed? I thought she was a rockstar. Why is she not taking any initiative?"" Again, the only thing which makes me focus at my work is last minute panic. If I have a major presentation, then the night before, I will pour over the data and make a good-enough last minute presentation. I have never been promoted at any job and anyway, I quit after 2 years anyway to catch the next bigger and shinier title.

&#x200B;

The same attitude extends towards my kids  as well. I love my kids and will die for them, but it's like I cannot be bothered to do the things they like. I sulk like a teenager if I have to take my kids to the park or if I have to play with them. There are days when I am in a great mood and on those days, my kids have a blast with me - laughing and playing the whole day. On days when I want to roll in a ball and do nothing, I snap at my kids for daring to interrupt my screen time or staring-into-space time. I hate what I am doing to them and constantly worry that my kids are going to be filled with regret  at how terrible their mom is. Worse, my kids are not going to  live their best life, because  they got my attitude.

&#x200B;

My house is always a mess and the only time I clean is if I know someone is coming  over. My kids cannot bring over impromptu friends because they will see a pigsty when they come in.

&#x200B;

I am now bored of my current job, started interviewing and landed my next job at a startup. I just accepted the offer and already, I am filled with a sense of dread.

&#x200B;

My husband absolutely loves me and is extremely supportive but I also fight a lot with him over chores. Half the days I just sit in front of the couch, watching tv, when there is a full sink of dishes and 5 loads of laundry  to be done. Even basic things like giving my kids a proper dinner or lunch  is sometimes a big deal for me. I tried to outsource those by hiring a cook to come everyday for an hour or 2, but that didn't work out. I am even embarrassed to have cleaners over and reschedule multiple times so that I have enough time to organize the house before they come to clean.

I have no idea what the hell is wrong with me. I hate living like this! I have absolutely nothing wrong with my life and I can live an amazing life. Why do I do this to myself? In my head, I know the ideal life I would love to live. I don't care for material things. I want to live a life of love and laughter, surrounded by friends and family. I want my kids to have the best life they possibly can. This seemingly simple thing, which everyone does, is something that has eluded me so far.How can I fix this?",Relaxed

trigger warning, mentioning of a lot of bad things. please take care <3

i have become a horrible person everyday to the people around me and myself. and i've been thinking of putting an end to it all, but not in a depressing way, but in a way where i aim to attain peace at last.

i'm slowly losing all the important people in my life like my best friends, boyfriend, and family. but that's only after i lost myself. my dad has been very abusive in all ways. i do not want to get in the details, but it has been very bad for the past few years. i began suppressing most of my emotions after i was hit, yelled at, and all that. the reason i suppressed them was because my father would threaten to hurt me even more if i dared to do anything. i love my mom so much but she never stood up for me because she loves my dad more than her own children. she's an amazing person but wouldn't say the best mother.

after years of suppressing all this anger and sadness while having no one to hear me out (i did not speak to friends about this because i did not want to be a burden), i have become a genuine monster. i first started by self harming a lot. and it was a really good source of relief. i felt the anger out of my body the minute i hurt myself. but then i did not want to mess my body up incase someone noticed, so i started using other sources of harm, like starvation for days (most painful), biting or hitting myself, and other ways. i think because i was dealing with it within myself as well, i wasn't properly expressing my anger or sadness. and i unintentionally became the worst friend and girlfriend. i would get angry at the slightest issues. i would try to wait till i go home to hurt myself so i do not project it onto the person who made me angry. but sometimes, it became hard.

so i've been slowly losing everyone around me. i feel too emotionally unavailable for my boyfriend (who is an amazing person), and feel no connection to anything in the world. i used to be a pretty ambitious person. i'm a painter, play the piano, enjoy writing, and professionally distance run. however, my love for those activities completely died down. i cant pick up a paint brush anymore or care to play a song on the piano. i do not care if my progress in fitness goes away. i do not mind if i lose everyone in the world.

i'm sort of glad people are starting to dislike me, because if i were ever to end it, i wouldn't want anyone to be hurt. a lot of my friends were upset i was never around, but i can tell they're all tired of trying, so they're letting go. i am really happy they finally get to let go of me (i am a terrible friend) and get what they deserve. i can tell my parents dont care about me anymore hence all the abuse, so if anything it'll be good. i've been planning to end it by thinking of ways and measuring the outcomes. i just want to make sure everyone in the world would not care if i was gone to not hurt them. then, i would like to do a couple of things like leave things for people i loved. and then pick the cleanest, best way to leave. i want it clean and painless. so i'm still thinking. i do not care to eat, so i was thinking about starving until it just ends. but i don't know how effective that will be.

i am just ready for peace. i am really exhausted of being abused by my father and being abused by myself. i do not care for the future. i used to have big dreams and have always been academically on track, but i just do not care anymore. honestly, i am most excited to be gone. i fantasize about it every night before i go to bed.i'm really struggling but i'm not even crying about it. it feels i cried all the tears God gave me. i'm just emotionless towards all of this. the only emotion i've truly felt this last month was anger. i just don't care and i am desperate for peace. this isn't meant to be depressing, i just think i have nothing left and i am not upset but i do wish everyone in my life well.

there are so many more issues and things to talk about, but i got lazy to continue to type and simply just don't care about saying anything else. because what's the point?

1851,"The more I see their delusions, the more I find peace inside  Recently I walked into a busy store on a Saturday afternoon. The store was buzzing with people all mulling about in this giant hive seemingly more and more coordinated as I faded up and into the ceiling. Disassociation swept over me, grey as the floor sinking beneath this idyllic portrait of reality. Now fully removed, I stood as an onlooker at the painting and imagined each life in brief detail as the faces passed through my view. Birthday parties and pillow fights, weddings and funerals, love stories and annulments. Graduations, baby showers, hospital visits, and summer pool parties. Snow days, sunsets, and drive-in movies. A shower beer, a payment plan. 


All of life suddenly explodes before me, good and bad. Its beautiful. And I am not a part of it because I am still staring at a painting, not a self-portrait. This world was never for me, I merely get to observe its happenings and wonder in awe about what it could feel like to go to Costco with my family and stress over brands of coffee. 


Please close your eyes in between reading this one to really picture it, I want to give you something beautiful:
>Imagine walking into a high school football game on a crisp fall evening. Remnants of warm summer air fade as the glow of a setting sun dips beneath the horizon. Families funnel between the parking lots into the stadium to reserve seats with blankets in anticipation of cold bleachers. An electrifying energy seems to reside over the stadium as the collective desires of each parent, friend, sibling, and player coalesces into a deeply sacred ceremony disguised as mundane athletic ritual. This is not about football. This is about the alchemy involved in bringing people together to cheer for their sons and daughters for that short period of time when we strive simply because we believe. Not to win fame or succeed, we want to win simply because we do. The pureness of this youthful desire pulls in our interest like nothing else and reminds us of the purity of simply striving for ourselves, surrounded in the love of friends and family. 


This is a moment outside of time I will never forget. A time when I ever so briefly got to peak behind the curtain and see the idyllic life so many people consider ""standard"", ""okay"", or ""decent"". To me this was the best and most normal I had ever felt to the point I wanted to cry, but for everyone else it was boring, mundane, and something they had to basically ""get through"". No wonder I feel so alone always. One person's drudgeries exceed my wildest dreams, how could we possibly relate?


All that to say, I can never relate with even the most baseline normalcy, whatever that means. No matter how hard we scream ""no one is normal"" what changes? You're still socially rejected and stigmatized for not being a <this> or a <that>. There's still not a seat for everyone at the table.



Finally I am starting to feel better because the world is waking up. We are all starting to see that something has been pulled over our eyes but we are not sure exactly how much. A few years ago we had never had a pandemic. A few days ago we had never had a UFO hearing. The world is vastly different and the Costoco family people now get to see a small glimpse of the hellish nightmare of chaos that has been my entire life. 


And that has been incredibly eye opening because people are so terrified that they won't even talk about the scary stuff. All of a sudden the same people that would tell me to get therapy are now in a state of psychosis because this time it effects them. While it is sad to see the denial and the insane depth of their delusions, I feel vindicated knowing we are the same. When faced with world crushing dread, we both crumbled. You just could not see the world that I saw until now. And now in its terrifying face you cry with me.



There are flying shapes in the sky Reddit, literally signs in the sky. But people would rather post about the latest political scandal or what some Tik Tok influencer thinks about how some celebrity responded to another celebrity. We need to keep waking up and unfortunately that means accepting some really scary truths like the nature of our reality in this universe, we were always here with something else. Or even just the fate of this planet, what are we even doing right now? All we do is let govcorp grind us to dust, there has not been a greater objective in forever. We need to embrace the unknown again and stop trying to diminish our existence just because the unknown is scary.

Anyway, hopefully you relate if you felt like you were crazy in a sane world, now we are slightly saner in a crazy world because bigger truths are being revealed and people have to choose whether to remain in denial or join the rest of us.",Relaxed
1852,"I need help finding peace, but my own head won¬¥t let me  Hello, I¬¥m sorta new on Reddit, so I¬¥m not sure if this is the place to post, but if it is, I¬¥d like to know if this also happens to you and, if so, how do you deal with this.

So I¬¥m 24, studying for college. I have a good life: a loving family, friends that I can trust and count on, and a wonderful girlfriend who loves and supports me. I have hobbies, and I¬¥m good at them too. I would say I¬¥m succeeding at this thing called life. The thing is, sometimes there is this voice in my head that hates me; judges me. It is like another me, but really mean. I¬¥d be washing the dishes minding my own business and suddenly I hear it ""remember that time when (insert some cringe moment) you are really an idiot"" or I¬¥m trying to do something and it¬¥s not working so well and there it goes saying how stupid I am.

It¬¥s not weird for me to have another voice talking with me, I mean, that¬¥s how I organise my thougths; if I have a lot of things to do, I¬¥d think ""Alright, first we¬¥re going to solve this thing, the we¬¥ll go eat, sounds good? Great"" or when I¬¥m upset, I go to a lone place and talk with myself out loud, like ""Alright, what¬¥s going on? I don¬¥t know, I think it¬¥s this thing, What about it?"", etc. The problem is when that voice (myself) is being mean to me. It¬¥s been a while now (couple years) that when I screw up or remember a bad moment I have that voice judging me and I have to do something to shrug it off, at first it was just a head movement, like a nod, then it was making any noise like yawning or clearing my throat, and now it¬¥s straight up whispering myself to shut up (when I¬¥m alone, as of now I haven¬¥t done that last one in public).

Today was too much though. I was trying to study but it was being a bit hard since I was tired, so I wasn¬¥t going as fast as I wished. So the voice once again started talking about how I¬¥m an idiot, a piece of shit who just can¬¥t keep focus, at first I tried not to pay attention to that, but it was too intense, and the more I tried to focus, the more loud was that judging voice. It was so much that I started crying, and ended up curling up in my bed, whispering ""stop being so mean to me""; I had to stop studying for the day.

I don¬¥t know why I do this. I¬¥m not a judging person, whenever someone else fails, I try to help them, support them. I tell them it¬¥s ok to fail, and it¬¥s ok to not get it right at the begining. I am a loving person, I forgive, I understand, I celebrate others. Why can¬¥t I be like that to myself? Everyone thinks dearly of me and are proud of me. I can¬¥t do that. Everytime there¬¥s this voice bringing me down, not allowing me to be sure of myself. That¬¥s what everyone tells me, that I should be more confident of myself, but how can I do that when I have this constant voice in the back of my head telling me that I¬¥m a piece of shit?

Does this happen to you? How do you deal with it? Are there any tips I can use, like some day to day exercises? I would appreciate the help, I want to be happy with myself, feel the same thing my loved ones feel about me, share it, be at peace.",Relaxed

1855,"Is it healthy to find peace of mind in human finality?  I have no idea if it is healthy, but I do find the finality of my life comforting at times. In the whirlpool of everyday concerns, it's easy to forget how short-lived and insignificant all of us really are. The thoughts of shame, anger, or sadness are difficult to justify in the wider context of human existence. And I do mean all of us. Regardless of wealth or social status or whatever other inadequate metric we might consider, all of us are playing the same game. Eventually, we will be forgotten no matter how great of an impact one might have made. It lessens my emotional response to my own failures but I know this can easily lead to a point where it's hard to care about anything because my successes are just as much more irrelevant.

This viewpoint also helps me with overcoming fear. Everyone experiences fear of the unknown or fear of the future. But the fear of the unknown is not present when confronted with the ultimate fate. This finality brings me peace of mind.

1859,"Seeking Advice on Dealing with Toxic Family Dynamics and Finding Mental Peace in Challenging Circumstances  I am 24 years old and come from a country where living with your parents until you die is very common. My mom got married at the age of 17 of her own will because my nana didn't accept my father and used to beat her, hoping she would leave my dad. My father's family is quite toxic. They never truly liked my mom and subjected her to mental torture. She had me when she was 18, and despite unfavorable circumstances and just giving birth, she managed to get into the country's top university. She went through a lot at a very young age, but am I to blame for that?  
  
A bit of background about my father: He had me when he was a university junior. However, my grandfather left us when I was 4. My father had to give up on his dreams to support a family of 6. He worked hard, but due to constant pressure and being ostracized by society for not coming from a wealthy background, he was often irritable and occasionally took out his frustrations on my mom for no reason. I have a lot of respect for my mom for her resilience through all her hardships, but these experiences have made her somewhat toxic, which she seems to pass on to me.  
  
Growing up, she would always blame me for ruining her life. She used to physically torture me a lot and scold me for the simplest things, which led me to become extremely introverted with low self-esteem. Ironically, she now blames me for being anti-social. Anyway, I wasn't a perfect child. I did some reckless things, but I felt that it was my way of escaping the mental torture I knew I would endure. When I became an adult, I started pointing out the toxic behaviors I had to endure from her. Sometimes, she would admit that what she did was wrong, but she often argued and called me ungrateful.  
  
I graduated from university this year and landed a high-paying job. Nowadays, whenever I point out her mistakes, she tells everyone that I've become prideful and impudent because I'm earning a good salary. Does this even make any sense?  
  
Before landing this job, I wanted to move to the USA to pursue higher studies and eventually get a job there. But every time I brought up the topic of moving abroad, she reacted negatively and called me selfish for wanting it. Since I now have a well-paying job, I'm thinking of working here for a couple of years to save up money because I don't want to rely on my family financially.  
  
Don't get me wrong, both of my parents always tried to give me the best life they could afford. They made sacrifices to see me happy. But sometimes, they act in toxic ways. When I was a child, if I did anything wrong, their go-to punishment would be confiscating all my electronic devices and calling me degrading names. They were always overprotective and strict, which made me feel isolated.  
  
Her behavior has become routine for me, but I'm tired of it. Just a few minutes ago, she was upset because I stopped treating my family with the little salary I used to earn during internships. I jokingly mentioned that one day she said that the food at an event was better than what I bought, and she became furious, calling me low-natured and cheap-minded. She screamed at me for an hour. I don't understand her. Why does she make a big deal out of such small things?  
  
I am currently in a romantic relationship for almost 4 years. My partner is really sweet and supportive, and I usually share everything with him. However, he's going through a lot right now, and I don't want to burden him with my problems at the moment. What should I do?

Plus I can already predict that 2023 will also be horrible for me. I know it won‚Äôt be. I‚Äôve tried the whole ‚Äústay strong and have hope‚Äù strategy.. didn‚Äôt work. 

23 years of being on this earth I‚Äôm going through the worst I ever have in my life. Dealing with heartbreak, family issues, struggling to get a new job despite how many jobs I apply for and I even call the jobs in which I apply at and still am having no luck. I‚Äôve been without a job for almost 3 weeks now. I recently was in a car wreck, and my vehicle was totaled.. so I‚Äôm working towards a new car but obviously I need a new job soon. On top of that I was literally fired for lies that were made up about me. I‚Äôm not even trying to make excuses for myself or say that I‚Äôm perfect because I‚Äôm not‚Ä¶ but I literally was fired for false accusations made up about me by coworkers that didn‚Äôt like me. 

 I have 9K in savings which should be enough for a used car.: but I‚Äôd rather save a little more so I can get one with working AC and one that‚Äôs good for travel. Plus I don‚Äôt want to blow up my savings when I‚Äôm currently without a job.

Also my name is being slandered in my small town with false rumors. My reputation has been destroyed with a horrible rumor that is absolutely false and I‚Äôve tried very hard to prove that the rumors are false but people in this town are extremely close minded and won‚Äôt even listen to me when I offer to prove myself. I‚Äôve lost a lot of my so called ‚Äúfriends‚Äù but I guess if those ‚Äúfriends‚Äù of mine let a rumor get in the way of us then I guess they were never true friends anyway.

As I mentioned before I have 9K in savings, I originally was saving up to move out of my small town and to start over somewhere new. My savings goal was 10K-15K and I knew what city I was going to move to. But all that was planned before the car crash and losing my job for 0 reason. I was so close to being able to start a new life in a new city.. then BOOM the car crash.. and BOOM my job gets snatched from me.

So obviously my move is postponed for at least another year. I have to use up a big chunk of my savings to buy a new car and I have to get a new job before I can even get my savings back up. On top of that.. my checkings account doesn‚Äôt exactly have a life time worth of money in it either.. so if I don‚Äôt get a job within 2-3 weeks and if my checkings ends up in a negative balance.. to avoid continuous negative balance fees.. I‚Äôll have to take even more out of my savings account. I don‚Äôt mean to be arrogant or full of myself, but I worked very hard on my savings towards moving and starting over. But now it means nothing.

I try so hard but nothing I do is ever enough. I‚Äôm under the impression I‚Äôll never find love again, I‚Äôll never get any of my blessings, and I‚Äôll never be happy.

1864,"Tips from a life coach on how to make peace with regrets  Regret is a difficult emotion to cope with.  It occurs when you think you should have done or said something, but you didn't. You wish you had a time machine that could take you backward, where you could make different choices and experience different outcomes.  
  
This thought pattern indicates a tendency to dwell on the past. In living in the past, you miss out on what is happening in the present, which will lead to more regrets in the future.  
  
  
A key to breaking this vicious cycle is to live in the present moment. Being present requires moving on from the past. How do you move on from the past? Acceptance is the only path. The ability to accept is among the things that are easier said than done. It requires acknowledging negative emotions, validating regrets, and telling yourself it's okay to feel that way. As human beings, we all feel regrets from time to time. Close your eyes, allow yourself to feel those regrets, sit with them, then let them go.  
  
  
After processing your emotions, reframing your old stories would be the next step. If you are regretful about something, it is usually because you think you would have achieved a better result if you had done something differently. This often isn't true. It is simply an illusion that you created in your mind. To empower yourself, you need to open your mind and start telling yourself a different story. Even if you had done something differently in the past, you never knew how it would turn out. It could be better or worse. Even if it's better than your current situation, it may not last. There are always ups and downs in life. Nothing is perfect or always going well. And sometimes the bad things that happen in our lives put us directly on the path to the most wonderful things that will ever happen to us. It's important to have a growth mindset. Instead of dwelling on your regrets, appreciate the lessons you've learned. It is only through the regrets that you have grown.  
  
  
The biggest insight that I gained from regrets was that the best cure for regret is courage. Fear and regret often go hand in hand. Often, the reason we regret not doing something is that we were paralyzed by fear at the moment when we should have taken action. Only by overcoming our fears and being courageous can we avoid regrets from happening in the future.   
  
  
Starting today, you can overcome regrets by doing this exercise: choose one thing you think you should be doing but are afraid to because of the uncertainty, e.g. approaching someone you like but not sure if they like you back,  getting in touch with a mentor you admire but not sure if they will accept you, trying out a new hobby or activity without any prior experience, attending an event where you don't know anyone.  
  
  
To avoid regrets, my invitation for you is‚Äîto do the opposite of what you don‚Äôt want, then face the consequences. Even if the outcomes don‚Äôt turn out to be what you expected, honor your courage, and celebrate your first steps toward living a life without regrets.

1866,"When protecting your property peace leads to loneliness  This year has been eventful. I started the year with a number of close friends, a best friend I considered to be a sister and a boyfriend. 

In February, I found out my boyfriend had a history of domestic abuse via coercion and control so I broke it off. I felt like he wanted to make me into a housewife and he would tell me what I could and couldn‚Äôt eat because he felt I needed to lose weight. So I cut him off. 

I acquired a serious leg break that required one week in hospital and surgery the next week - and my best friend who also has bipolar had stopped taking her meds in December. She was very mean to me and totally disappeared when I came from hospital even though she lives literally down the corridor. We spent the whole of lockdown together and had been friends for years. I was so hurt I cut her off‚Ä¶ and it was ok but now I miss her a lot. 

My other friend who has bipolar got unwell and was unable to be there for me so. She had a baby and her boyfriend is also abusive so she‚Äôs not really been around ‚Ä¶understandably. 

I had sport friends but I really fancied one for a long time and accepted we were just friends. We were hanging out a lot and then he would initiate sex often so I got my hopes up. When I asked him about it he still just wanted to be friends but maybe with benefits. I was hurt so kind of cut him out too. 

another mate has really gotten into their girlfriend so is around less. When I broke my leg I also lost playing rugby and fell out with the coach because I had a mental health crisis too. I also lost my work and I had to take a year out of my studies. 

My parents really stepped up for me but since I‚Äôve been more stable and better naturally they‚Äôve got back to their lives more. They still call regularly and I am 32 but they live far away too. 

I‚Äôve started to feel really lonely. I‚Äôve taken some work as a freelancer but I am so socially awkward now. 

I‚Äôm wondering if in the quest for protecting my peace I have cut too many people out because I felt hurt by their actions. I now spend A LOT of time alone and my mental health is struggling a bit. 

I struggle to talk sometimes. I want to but my voice won‚Äôt speak and my mouth won‚Äôt move. I‚Äôm back on disability benefits and have found the local gardening group for people with mental illness not that great for me. I feel like the life I had in 2021 is so so far away and I am lonely now. 

Any ideas on what to do?

I went to watch the team play rugby yesterday which was nice but I can‚Äôt train or anything still. I am learning to run just now. 

I really miss my best friend - and I think she misses me too because she keeps sending me messages of things that remind her of me. 

I get that she was unwell but she confided in me in December that if her team continued saying they were ready to discharge her she would stop taking her meds so they wouldn‚Äôt. So I see that as a choice to manipulate the team and I find that hard to empathise with really. And the stuff she did to me, she stole from my bank card, she slammed the communal door in my face when I was coming in to the building on crutches.

Evil Voice: Oh no! He has blood on his finger. You might get HPV or HIV from this.  
Me: No way! STDs can't be transmitted like that. I'll take the crab home and cook it. Viruses can't survive that. (I won the argument)  
**Later, when I left the market, I saw a homeless lady with her children, and I wanted to give her some money.**  
Evil Voice: You could also give her the crab since you're dealing with OCD. Don't make yourself eat it if you're worried about virus infection. Trust your instincts. (Evil voice won)  
**I gave her the crab and walked away.**  
Evil Voice: What if she has allergies? Your crab might harm her. You made a bad decision, and you're a bad person. (The evil voice succeeded in scaring me)  
I went back to the lady (thankfully, she was still there) and asked her, ""Can you eat crab?"" using Google Translate because she didn't speak English. She replied in broken English, ""Ggood, my son... eat a lot.""  
**I understood that she and her son could eat it, and the evil voice stopped bothering me. But as I drove home, it kept going.**  
Evil Voice: What if she misunderstood your question? What if she didn't fully grasp your message through the Google Translate on your phone? What if something happens to her because of your actions? You should find her and clarify once more. (And so on...)

  
Thanks to the friends on Reddit who helped me analyze the situation in other topic. They helped me calm down by arguing with the evil voice. Their advice was: ""No intent, no guilt. She is an adult, she made her choice, she knows herself and what she will eat. You are not in control of it."" That helped a lot, and the evil voice quieted down. Sometimes it still lingers a bit, but it doesn't really scare me.  
Returning to the initial question: How would you deal with this situation if you were in my shoes?

1870,"Happiness is external, peace is internal    People are obsessed with being happy or finding true happiness.  On their quest to finding happiness, they will stumble across a genre of  people claiming that all you need is yourself to find happiness. That  is where the first big mistake happens. To be happy you must feel a  certain level of pleasure and contentment. To want extent, it‚Äôs all a  matter of personal preference and depends on the situation. Monks for example have a high degree of contentment and pleasure in their simple  life. If you were to ask someone to give a description of a monk they would most likely say that monks are disciplined. The word happy would  not come to mind. When the everyday person is happy, you may ask why are  you so happy. If they reply I‚Äôm just a happy person, you make think to  yourself that this person is a loon. That is not a mistake, you  intuitively know happiness comes from external factors but when it comes  to yourself, you think differently.

   Now it‚Äôs not all helpless because what you can attain for  yourself is peace. When I say peace I‚Äôm not referring to peace in a  country or hippie peace and love. Peace for a country means they are not  in wartime and hippie peace is more happiness because of all the  extracurricular activities needed to achieve that state. What I‚Äôm  getting at is a constant state of calmness, not too high or not too low.  A sense of stillness, that feeling you get knowing that no matter what  happens everything is going to turn out all right. Some people will  consider that happiness and that‚Äôs OK. Some people are happy when they  get very angry because they get to break things. We are complicated  beings.¬†

   Happiness like anger is an intense emotional feeling on the same  spectrum. Being level headed or at peace is somewhere above the middle.  Indifference is smack dead centered. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong but I don‚Äôt see how  anyone one can reach those extreme emotional feeling without some sort  of outside interference. If they do shift from two extremes without  external interference that may be due to a medical mental disorder. When  you go to a party or a social event that is something that can make you  happy. Even when you are cleaning your house or donating to a charity,  you may have feelings of happiness but the feelings are short-lived.  Repeat actions may not bring the same intensity of happiness. On the  other hand meditation and not dwelling on past mistakes will give you a  seems of inner peace and that is much more sustainable.¬†

   I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt look for external people or objects for  happiness. I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt look inside you to be happy. Do activities  to improve yourself so you can have spikes of happiness. Do things like  playing sports, reading, writing, drawing, hanging out with friends, and  occasional shopping. You can only look in yourself to find peace. Peace  should be the baseline because there are situations where you may have  to bring out your dark side. If you‚Äôre already close to the middle, you  can achieve elevated situation appropriateness. Remember peace and  happiness, internal and external. Inner peace is where you live,  happiness is where you play.¬†

Thirdly  
Some context for my backstory and real start of the post ( i will try to make it as short as possible )   
When i was around 5/6 ( he was 18/19 or 16/17 dont rlly remember eneven if i was 4/5 or 5/6 bu it was happenin for around year app. 1-2 times month) i was molested by my cousin but he manipulated me into thinking is normal,  jist aftel lot of years it came back to me since the memory was long locked and thats when i realized its was not normal ( normal in my family trusts me that it was happening cu i ,,didnt said anything back then, or a seem happy when he was on family reunions, or i stayed at some different cousins party when he came there or much more but thats the main reasons they dont belive it happened )  
  
In my 10 years my father left my mother, me  and my sister and started new family after living with my mother for 25yrs wich i didnt took any good but i survived it cuz my mother started dating father of my friend from our very small city whom i took as brother. So we moved all together, me, the new mothers partner and my brother ( even not by blood but by feelings for sure ) My sister is 16 yrs older so she was living elsewhere  
  
Everything seems ok till my 15, im living in biggest city in my country by then, my new older brother ( older by 5 yrs ) learned me to skate, smoke weed somethimes any by like what some cringe tv show was cool kid even tho everything i said did everyone just not nerds.  
  
When i was 15 he got diagnosed with cancer and he dies 14 days after my 16th birthday. i was completly desroyed and thought that that was rock bottom till my best friend for 3 years ( since i moved to the main city ) dies in my hands not  even 2 months after the dead of my so called brother - then i started using meth like crazy cuz thaths cheap and everywhere here, xanax, ambien and ketamine, from time to time i popped some E but the meth was daily thing. but becouse the dead of my brother my mother doesnt pay to mmuch attention to the world after and finds about it afet full year, i go to rehab for yungsters and stayed 3 months, after i got out i was sober for 8 months ( only got beer on fridays with friends or twice a mont app joint but thats rlly all for 8/9 months)  
  
After that i got prescribed DHC dihydrocodeine ( less strenght compared to morphine but like 10x more compared to classical codeine or tramadol ) wich when i popped 400mg without any opiate tolerance felt like fakin heaven, no isomnia like meth, noone can rlly tell that im high soo i got the doc to overprescribe for about 4/5 months after wich he got on my plan and cut me off but that was late.I imedealty started searching for opioids on streets or web or from  friends, everywhere, after around 14days of nonstop internet formums and annoying my friends i got one name of friend of my friend that he takes something called oxycodone and that sould do what im looking for, it did. soo much my tolerance was after app year and half after meeting him soo high i was doin 8-12 80mg a day ( we in europe still have them original oxycontin but we took every pill that had some opioid stronger then morphine includning morphine, anything less potent lost value to us ) i go tru wds nonstop, lots of friend overdoses so i try rehab again ( i was freshly 20 at that alreaey time in 3yr relationship wich started when i was 17, with the most beautiful girl wich was studyin medicine and that agreed to our relations ship when i was in phase just doin DHC, lean and didnt tell about everytime so she thought i just take some weak opioid from timew to time ), singhed of that rehab after 30days and lost my main pills plug, thats when i started smoking heroin at that time my dad foound out about his cancer and died only 2 months after bein moved to different city cuz even in the relationship we agreed on pause, i found new girl in the new city with wich i fell in love insanely and wich i have found hanged in our flat 3 months after living together, thats when i started shootinh that heroin and moved back to my mothers flat  
  
For year i steal, shoot, sell just being jungie like every other  
after year like that my mother tells me its even rehab or street, so i try rehab again, this time i stayed for 7 mpnths and was rlly feeling like thats last time i see inside of rehab. . y  
  
today its app. 1 year ago since i left that rehab, after i left i lasted 14 days so i tryied metadone wich worke best from all but still is not great, yea i dont need to steal and i hav job,  but job in wich is still some trouble cuz my using becouse somethimes i smoke some crack to my methadone, or pop some xan and again a signed that i want to different type to rehab then last time, its the only type i havent tried but fuck seein my mother cry all the time, seein my gf hanged in dreams or seein all that ppl that shouldnt be dead is too much, i dont have the strenght. i dont know if i should end it rn or wait the 4 months waiting list to this so called ,,bes rehab"" in our country or just dont wait after i came from there, relapse like everytime and kill myself anyway, cuz if this wont work im gonna end it 110% cuz i tried it all but learning from my past i dunno if im not just prolonging my remorse and hate for existence and for all that trauma for another year just like, idk even know why ???? i already have a rope",Relaxed

1878,"Stop unhealthy addictions: a case for mental peace  Dear reader,

Life can be tough. Everyone suffers in some way or another. There is no way out of the suffering. Nonetheless: You can minimize the suffering. And the start of that minimization should be at your body and mind.

When the body receives negativity, in the sense of unhealthy supplements, would the mind then produce negative thoughts? How would you feel when taking too much caffeine everyday, or nicotine, salt, sugar, alcohol, etc? I suppose: not so good. How would you feel when taking in too little sunshine everyday, water, vegetables, vitamins? Also not so good - I must admit. There is enough scientific knowledge to prove my point.

If you want to minimize your suffering, you'll have to tackle the negative routines of your daily way of life - and implement those routines with positive energies. Like: instead of smoking a cigarette, you drink water. Instead of sitting on your chair, you go and move your body. Etc. These little changes will gradually make changes into your life. I know that when you experience the improvement, you will hold onto the positive energy. Much discipline and motivation is not even needed. Too much suffering should be motivation enough. And enough remembrance of the suffering should keep you disciplined enough to hold on to the positive.

Peace be upon you, brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews.",Relaxed

First off, you and I will exchange information in order for you to choose out of three different horses. Chances are, you will resonate better with a specific horse based on it's physical appearance, back story and age.

Before your equine therapy session, I will introduce your name and the main reason of your needs to the horse so he is ready and receptive.

These past 9 months of quarantine have been interesting, with lots of time for self awareness, solitude, to sit in myself and be with myself. I have learned a lot, I still struggle. I am healing & I still hurt. I am getting comfortable with my identity, I still struggle with dysphoria. It is all apart of the life of being. The life that yes must have its downs, to know what the ups are. To know that the downs only last for a little while and then there we are, bouncing back up again. It takes time.

Sometimes I feel too secluded and wanting to chat with someone I used to talk to, or someone that has been removed from my life by God and the Universe that I want to check up on just because I feel lonely. We must be present with ourself in those moments and realize that **WE MUST NOT MOVE BACKWARDS BECAUSE WE ARE FEELING LONELY.** There are 1000's of people on the internet to chat with if needed, but realistically in those moments it might be best not to message anyone at all and just sit. 

I love speaking with people, I love conversing, I love communicating and experiencing different perspectives with like minded beings in other places in the world, but as well as I love my space and time for me; to paint, to journal, to meditate, to be outside, to play video games or just solely to sit.

Find whats right for you and focus on that. Connect with people that have unconditional love for you, if you are looking for people like that, go look, they are there and here. All around. I wish you a day of health, happiness and healing. **Together, Separately.**

1894,"You cannot count on other people to give you peace or closure  Some of you may have been lucky, perhaps you got a heartfelt apology from someone who felt super remorseful for how much pain they've caused you.

Unfortunately, most people just won't get that. In my younger years, I was naive. I thought that because I am wrecked with guilt when I realize I've hurt someone, then all other people must be, too. And sure, some people are. I'm not egocentric enough to think I'm one of a kind. But the truth is, most people aren't thinking about having hurt you at all. Even if they know full well they did. Those types of people, if you brought it up to them, they'd just get defensive. Make you feel worse than you did before. And there are many people like this. Humankind seems to be one hell of a harsh species.

I'm not saying this in a bitter way, although it might sound like it. It's just something I've come to accept, and you must too. Because waiting for someone else to give you closure, or an apology, is a waste of your time. It's crazy-making. It'll keep you seething for years.

We've all seen movies and TV shows in which people always seem to come to their senses. When they experience pain, they must think of us and what they've done to us, right? Surely, on their death bed, they'll be sorry? Surely, because the pain has caused you to lie awake at night, they can't sleep either knowing what they've done to you, right? Right?...

No. Life is not the movies. Most people who were callous to you don't care. Heck, even most people who have routinely abused others don't care.

For almost a year, I (21M) had wierd feelings down my genital area when I was around kids and my sister. During this Christmas, I was home and I spent more time with my sister. At first, I had those feelings down my genital area, but, with time, those became more rare and I barely even noticed anything. Then she left and I was alone with my parents for a week. I had to mention that I didn't go outside much these two weeks. 

Today, I came back in the city where my college is (my sister's too) and I had to help her with some luggages and... 

The exact moment the I saw her face at the window, those feelings in my genital area came back and those persisted. Worse, I noticed little kids again and I became more aware of my genital area. I was so relieved when those feelings started to ware off and I'm yet again back here...

For those asking, I'm attending meetings with a psychologist. But after two meetings, she said that she thinks because I have a great relationship with my sister, that she was always there for me, that I think she is attractive and ahe has some traits, that I like on other girls, and the fact that I never had a girlfriend came over each other and that's why I have these wierd feings. This response sounded like she thinks that I feel attracted to her which just make things worse... I need to mention that she suggested me not to talk about my problems on the internet, but I really need to vent right now.

1897,"I feel like I am finally moving on... and at peace  TL:DR; I moved on by accepting and forgiving all the abuse and that I will become a very different person, so I will make good use of the fact.

For years I have been struggling on what I should feel about my discovered bad familiar situation, inumerous existential crisis happened, inumerous ways of thinking, a lot of pain.

And i feel that, recently, I finally feel at peace with it, that i am starting to move on and be happy with my decisions.

And I did that by just accepting that it happened and forgiving my mother. Understanding that if things were just a little different, she would have a way better life, I never asked for this, but so she didn't, she hurted me yes... but I also hurted her even if it wasn't on purpose, and that's okay... it's just a bad situation overhaul for both of us.

And the after effects, such as personality changes and views changes, I think I am also starting to accept that.

That i am finally accepting that I lost or haven't developed inumerous parts that would make me fully human, but... I am quite enjoying the results, and they don't scare me anymore. 

Maybe it's a good thing even, atleast I think it is... I feel special, I feel like I can do stuff that only I can do.

I may loved isolation but social interactions always happened no matter what. But life changed and I was long periods of time alone at home where unpredictable social situations didn't happen. 

The realization of me needing others is not calming, because it puts me in position where I am the one who needs takes steps toward meeting other people (finding job, study again...).

I don't need to be more extroverted I don't need to be ""actively making friends"", people will probably find way into my life unintentionally through job/school etc.

1901,"Will I ever find peace?  Reposted from r/offmychest
   

I am 13 years old, no this is not me trying to be edgy, I have serious mental issues. It all started a year ago. Something started to change. I would be seriously distressed by seemingly banal and unimportant things.

But the thing that puzzled me the most is that it would be very specific things that would trigger that horrible reaction. Just seeing a picture of the Russian sleep experiment? Can't sleep for a whole month, started having delusions that I may be unable to sleep forever. There are many more but alas. I'm too panicked for that right now.

I have always tried to do good, always resisted bad thoughts, always helped people, told them
they are worth, and yet I cannot save myself?

This is my breaking point, the thoughts and pictures which challenge my core values, it's horrific, why can't I think good? From one thing to another, first it was the sleepless nights, and now.. I have perverted thoughts about animals?
Do you realise how painful it is? To even write this?
Do you know how hard it is fighting an internal battle every moment? I feel like I'm dying, my heartbeat increases, my mind turning into a haze.

I have prayed so many times, why can't you save me from myself, God? I have always done good and yet, I am forced to suffer endlessly, why can't I be a normal child? Why can't you take me back a few years ago when everything was ok?

I have never told anybody about the specific thoughts since they are so inhumane. I realise that this may be another reason why I am destroying myself, but I do not want to burden anybody, no never. I don't want to be a burden to this world, I don't want to become that which I have sworn to never be. And if I don't make it, grant me a peaceful death, for I cannot fight anymore.

I am stuck in this vicious cycle, the more I resist the stronger these thoughts get, and more inhumane feelings I'm not even supposed to feel come and darken my vision.

Let it be known that I have always at least tried to be a good person. If only I knew what my mind would become now..

I 19 (F) spend several hours a day walking in circles in my room and talking to myself, making up scenarios and acting out by making faces and talking out loud like the characters in the scenarios. This happens every single time I feel any strong emotion and lasts 1-3 hours. I don‚Äôt even notice when I start doing it. I only realize i‚Äôm mid jumping and talking when someone or something distracts me. I‚Äôve been to a therapist and have been diagnosed with OCD and have been told I have episodes of disassociation. When I told my parents about my diagnosis they completely snapped at me calling me weak and saying that ‚Äúmentally ill people never amount to anything in life‚Äù that I‚Äôm perfectly fine and that I just need to shut up and learn to control my emotions and outbursts.

Haven't been able to work so I'm behind on rent and will probably get kicked out later today if I can't get the money.  But that's not the major sadness is coming from. Just got the call that the tests came back from my time in the ER and that they suspect cancer probably of the liver, breast lymph nodes.

1905,"Is it too much to ask for Peace and Stability?  I've lived all my life in chaos, looking back, all I can see in my life is, My mom and dad fighting, my mom beating me up to a pulp, my mom attempting suicide, Me running away from home when I was about 10, me attempting suicide at the same age, my mom beating me up again, she traumatizing my brother, calling him a failure and saying that he wouldn't graduate from high school, she cheating, she running away from my dad while still married, cheating with someone else, taking me with her, she beating me up to a pulp again that I hated to stay at home, my attendance was 99%, 2 days leave because I got fever. Me catching her in the act, me running away from my mom, she came back and got back together with my father only to fight with him till this day, all of this before I was 14. And then our family is all together again and everyday from there is a trauma, constantly calling us failures, forcing us to take sides between my mom and dad, my mom squeezing my father out for money, she squeezing out her brothers for money, beating me to a pulp, she attempting suicide again, she hitting her head with weird things to make it bleed, she calling me ugly, she starting fights between my father and my grand father, and then between my father and his sister, she forcing my father's hand to send my grandparents to orphanage, she calling me and my brother a failure, she squeezing me for money, she bodyshaming me, she constantly showing more love to my brother that it's absolutely obvious that even my brother started hating her, she pushing me to suicide, in that exact order till June 2020

Enter my one sided love, who single handedly gave me trauma that made me question my existence, gave me GAD, made me question my worth, squeezed me dry while I tried to be a friend.

Enter my ex, gave my anxiety back, made me question everything I do, made me question if I am really kind, made me question if I know what is love, made me question if I am capable of ever loving someone, made me question if I ever deserve love, (sorry if you are reading this)

After all this, I never hurt someone, have strong morals, always kind, I do not lie, help everyone, value everyone, respect everyone, never judged someone, never smoked, never consumed alcohol, always tried to do my best, strived to make my parents proud, loved my ex with all my heart, never cheated, loyal enough that I never looked at another woman after I was in love. I take care of my brother both mentally and financially, treated him with respect, gave my father support when he needed it, tried to fix my mom till an year ago, I tried to do everything right morally.

After all this I was tired and all I could honestly think about is suicide, for sooooo long. Now that I conquered that, all I have left is enough trauma to make me stop smiling when am truly happy. Question if I truly deserve to be happy, feel bad for being happy. Feel guilty for enjoying music, for enjoying to travel. At this point, all I was left is with feeling sad while driving/riding which I usually enjoy the most. 

All I want from this life is to get the ability to forget and move on, to stop feeling guilty for being happy, to be with someone who would enjoy their time with me, without me questioning myself if I deserve them, to like driving again, to not feel impulsive to compensate for the loss of control on life.

1.Live fully/mostly in the present moment. Thoughts come and go but you don't pay attention to them as they are mostly background noise. Most of your attention is focused on your senses 

2.Accept any sensation in your body. Whether it be tension/discomfort/pain/etc Once you're able to do 1 and 2, is that it to achieve mental peace/tranquility

Not saying this is easy(requires breaking habits like overthinking) It took me a while and I'm still rereading books like ""Power of Now"" and ""Radical Acceptance"" to get better at this.

And I looked at her gross baby hands and thought ""what if I just...let go of my disgust for gross baby hands? What if I just relax"" and I did, I let her touch my shirt and my face with her baby hands, and with that came something new that I haven't felt without needing to force myself to, I cried, a smiling chuckling teary eyes cry that only my sister amora has pulled from me in the past month or so, I cried two days ago to try and help my pain,ni had to force myself, this was something different, it was real, genuine and when I looked her in her eyes I felt happy for the few seconds that this happened during.

1908,"Narcissism brought me peace  I‚Äôve struggled with depression and anxiety almost my entire life. A major reason is my mom and all the emotional shame and neglect I‚Äôve dealt with from her.
Wearing makeup was shameful, too much time talking with my dad, not enough energy to do things spur of the moment ( I have 12 chronic illnesses and pain), shamed for PTSD caused by anaphylactic reaction she caused and didn‚Äôt apologize for but played dumb about, shamed for needing help moving furniture. 

I‚Äôve tried for so many years to have logical, rational conversations with her about big issues just trying to find peace and resolve things. But every time she would blow up and start yelling, trying to pull me into a screaming match and then would turn it around onto other things so there‚Äôs no resolution. 
I‚Äôve been going to counseling for years for CPTSD and talk therapy and really trying to own my own shit and take responsibility. I believe there are things I need to do better at, but for decades now I just couldn‚Äôt figure out why my mom and I can‚Äôt have rational conversations using cognitive behavioral therapy. She‚Äôs made me feel like all our relationship issues were my fault. 

In the last three months I was watching a medical show where they described narcissism in a way I‚Äôd not heard before. I was shocked and started crying because it fit my mom to a T. I felt like I‚Äôd been given a gift. I‚Äôm a nurse but hadn‚Äôt heard narcissism laid out as thinking like you are the only one in the world who cares so deeply about helping people. So much so that you feel you have to do it all like staying busy until you drop and neglect your family and children and self...because no one else in the world is going to be as kind to them as you would. 

I‚Äôve now been researching and realizing my mom is a true narcissist, or a ‚Äúcommunal narcissist‚Äù and damn good at hiding it. I‚Äôve been watching YouTube videos by Lisa A Romano and others as they describe how to combat narcissists and deal with their verbal assaults. 
This is the first time in my life I‚Äôve had peace about myself and not felt shame about who I am. I‚Äôm finally realizing that all the fights I had growing up with her were due to her narcissism and the fact that she couldn‚Äôt handle my emotional intelligence surpassing her own. 
Ive hated myself for years, felt guilty whenever I was given nice things or taken on a trip or allowed to have something my mom couldn‚Äôt. She would send me letters telling me how jealous she was of me, and I felt I deserved it. A few times she got my brother to call me with her to tell me how worried they were at the kind of person I was becoming. The constant judgment and shame was deep and harsh. 

I‚Äôve moved away from her now and had already been cutting off contact by blocking her on social media and by phone. I haven‚Äôt spoken to her in over 6 months and it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve started to feel good about myself. 

I would never have thought to look into this mental health diagnoses because she comes across as a very loving and outgoing person who gives to everyone. But behind closed doors she turns into a witch and feeds off of the energy of a fight. 
Anyways, I‚Äôm not saying everyone is a narcissist now, but if you‚Äôre struggling with feelings of shame, neglect, wondering why you don‚Äôt feel good enough, feel controlled by a parent/spouse or friend I highly urge you to look into this. I‚Äôm finally on my way to healing with the help of my mental health counselors and the right medication. Arming myself with the truth and information has been a huge help too. 

I wish I‚Äôd known about this sooner but I‚Äôm so grateful for knowing it about it at all. 
I was literally questioning my sanity because the things she would accuse me of didn‚Äôt make sense logically. We could never get through a conversation and go from point A to B because she would distract and manipulate. Classic statements were like: ‚Äúwhy is it always about you?‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre always so negative‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe already talked about this in the past, can‚Äôt you leave it in the past‚Äù (but it‚Äôs not ever resolved). 

Anyways, I hope this helps someone because I feel like a million pounds has been taken off my shoulders and that I now know I‚Äôm not crazy. She‚Äôs got a mental health issue that‚Äôs dangerous and I can‚Äôt be around her without having strong set boundaries. I‚Äôve learned that I can‚Äôt ever talk with her about this, it won‚Äôt get me anywhere and will only feed the fire. So I just have to be ok with knowing myself. 
Trust yourself and if you feel like someone is manipulating you, talk to a friend or write down what it is they‚Äôre doing a ask a mental health professional.

I have lived with 24/7 anxiety and a constant pressure on my chest, which won't go away.

I have seen all kinds of apycalyptic endings of the world with no way of being able to save one self. Two days ago I saw one of these dreams again. This one had an ever lasting winter and night, no place to warm upp and no light anywhere. At some point I was chased for what felt for hours and then - suddenly - I was finally able to stop, I was able to smile, and then and there: me as a 10year old child commited suicide and turned into a snowflake. I saw my family mourn, I saw them find a new child in the snow (that wasn't me) and I saw their heart broken.

I never knew how to even change a diaper and the screaming of the kids every night I eventually got used to .

She was still legally married to the father of her children . He paid for everything she was a stay at home wife . He cheated on her and thats when I met her right in the middle of that . When he found out about me he would take her children from her and keep them months sometimes which was definitely not agreed with the mother . Drove her into a deep depression . All the signs were there. She previously tried to Kill herself when I was at work she took pills but luckily she survived . Didn‚Äôt realize the extent to it .

There is much trauma in his background and I'm worried it prevents him from living his best life. As a child, his mother left him to start another family, he was raised by grandparents and cousins; he was the only white boy in his school; he left school in 8th grade; a friend of his fell & died while hopping trains together; his uncle and aunt sexually molested him; he entered a boys' home and was molested again; at age 16 he began a new chapter in a different area of the country. 

Nowadays he longs to move away from society, and is hating life where he is instead of enjoying the love and good fortune around him.

Now I am in a good place. I am in counseling. I‚Äôm on the right meds. I left an emotionally abusive first living situation and am now in a dorm with quiet, caring people. I‚Äôm doing far better in my classes and my accommodations are going a long way. New people are talking to me for the first time in a while. I have so much more free time.

However, I still can‚Äôt shake how I used to feel. I‚Äôm waiting for the good thing to end when I want to enjoy it in the present. I‚Äôm constantly scared of what I‚Äôm going to do wrong or if I‚Äôm too loud and annoying, so I‚Äôm hyper apologetic and communicative.

Long story short, my friend was found dead which is believed to be suicide.
Well he is not my best friend but we're on really good terms.. he was suffering from depression since his father died two years ago and he attempted suicide once I think resulting in him being in a coma which he woke up from it.
It feels really crappy.. he was a kind soul, smiling most of the time and although we didn't see each other much, he still meets me with the same positivity that I have known him for.
I feel dreadful right now as I'm writing these lines.. still kind of shocked about it.. what broke my heart is seeing his devastated mother, trying to get close while they're burying him, crying qand sobbing.

Rest in peace my friend! See you in the next world!
May God have mercy on you.

Just a thought crossing my mind. If someone suicidal could see the crying faces of his beloved ones after he dies, would he still do it?

After working for about 5 years in an industry that I had major ethical conflicts with, my husband and I worked to put ourselves in a situation where I could leave. AND I DID! It was a major achievement for me, and a huge mark of my progress. I was unemployed for about 3.5 months, and finally obtained a nice, slow paced job that allows me to use my education and professional skills that I've obtained. It's a work from home job. It's flexible in terms of how I manage my responsibilities, and there's plenty of opportunity for continued learning and professional growth. The dreeeeaaaaam. I get to start my mornings slow, and work with my brain/body the way I need to during my day. I get to be at home with my pup all day. I get to work in my safe space, which will lead to some really positive outcomes for my work productivity. I've always worked best when I'm set up in this way - I came to learn that about myself when I started school/work online at the beginning of COVID.

The job I'm starting does not pay excessively well, especially in comparison to what I had been making in the previous industry I was in. But no worries there - I'd rather make less money doing work that I feel good about. 

My husband and I haven't achieved all of our major goals. We are still working towards saving for a house and having a few kids. But we are both able to trust that all of that will come with time. :-)

Buuuuuut... I'm so used to operating in chaos. I'm not used to slowing down. I have worked really hard to get back in tune with my body, to trust its cues.

For example, at school, I want to be the best. When I don't achieve that, I wonder what's wrong with me. Why can't I be better than my classmates? I would then study and push myself until my body physically gets sick (i.e. vomiting, crying, not sleeping).

Another example, in my relationship with my loving bf, whenever things are going well, I start an argument or bring up a painful topic. When he fails to comfort me, I tell myself that he's not the one for me and would think about breaking up.

I also think about future scenarios in my head that scares me, and I force myself to think about them in case they actually happen so that I'm prepared. I never feel truly happy and I feel like my thought cycle is sabotaging my inner peace and happiness.

Tldr,I know but please I need someone to hear my story as no one ever will. I need help and I can't live like that



I'm a really demaged persona. Here's a short summary of my life up until the point I live in now which is unbearable. 

I am the only child alive after several previous miscarriage.

I was tied to a chair in the back of a resturant while I was with my family and playing in the surroundings with them losing an eye on me. I was psychologically tormented and practically held against my will at the age of 4/5

I was always going out with kids way beyond my age even then so it was a real reality check when at the age of 5 my ""best friend"" told me everyone was just pretending and that nobody likes me and they all just use me as a laughing stock.

My parents divorced when I was six.
I went from a relatively above average lifestyle to poverty, living with my mom. She was working overtime so I had to take care of myself and spend up to 10h alone going into midnight in the old house of my grandparents with nothing but video games and tv for me to find comfort in.

At a school camp in first grade, I got severely Ill and could here my bunkmates wishing me death while I was a sleep.

I was bullied up until grade 5 for my good grades and manner's even tho nobody ever cared about my school work or tried to help me with it.

I found myself in a different friend group by that time, still being really withdrawn from people and not really being like anyone else.
I developed my first crush in grade 5, it was a girl that was in that friend group, innocent and trying to fit in but I saw she was different. She had been ""outcasted"" for that and I stuck with her and later convinced the other's to let her back. Anyway sorry for making this so detailed. 
One day, she was raped and sexually harresed by those same individuals at that age, in front of me. I was frozen, I didn't know and realize what was happening and I left her there. We were all very much kids, even tho some were something way more sinister...

I resorted to being alone and playing video games.
I was hitting puberty at that time and was really confused without again a stable support or parent figure. 
I found myself in a group of people online that I yet again called ""friends"" they were bullying me day n night calling it jokes, they were incredibly bad and toxic influence which had an impact on my behavior as I just broke and started being more like them.
I would be violent, angry, agreessive towards others.

My school grades were rappidly decreasing, I was scared and confused, I was feeling extremely stressed and anxious.
I developed ocd which was fueled by the stress, I didn't tell anyone and tried to hide it. It was controlling and destroying me even more. 

I menaged to pull through all this, to get away from those friends, to challenge my ocd and to fix my personality and behavior.
A big play in that was metal music which by the end of 5th grade, I rediscovered.  A lot of people say ""that"" or ""this"" saved me but metal music really saved me, it played such a big role in my life and the musician would never even know how impactful they were.
In 6th grade I was moved to another class, seemingly more elite one. I was doing better there and the bullying was almost none. Yet again I changed my friend group, didn't really fit there but I liked some of the people.
I still had parts of toxicity left with me. I started introducing two of my classmates into pc gaming, one of alienatedy friend group from me and we would frequently crash personalities with me feeling enraged by his wack if logic and just pure bad for the sake of bad. 

7th grade came. I was practically more matured, really misunderstood and ahead of my peers, I developed a complex of my age.

Just need to add I've always hated how I look. 

I found my first actual love and first to be girlfriend, she was so kind and understanding, she was so interesting and lovely. I never really felt so understood or comforted by anyone, no one ever liked me at all or treated me good. We had a 4 year age difference and I fabricated my age of being one year more out of fear in the early stages of our communication. I have suffered for that and I repent, don't hate me for it as I already hate myself enough.


This was the first actual happy point in my life for years tho.


My father one day announced to me that I will have a half brother, I told him that I won't love him and he screamed at me calling me an egoist.
I still don't love him, it's not the kids fault, he has the blood of true evil and sin running through him, his mother, a person who brutally broke a family up. I could never love the creation of hers. 



Moving on. 


My friend group had completely kicked me out.
A year passed and we reunited with them, both sides realizing the mistakes. 


Few months pass
My girlfriend had clingy tendancies and I was okay with that but sometimes I just couldn't manage, I was feeling stressed and I was having moments of anger and fear when we had a difference in something,just pure emotion, unexplained by anything to this day, along with the lie after few rough months I ended our relationship for her good and never told her the truth so I don't hurt her more.

I am a bad person
Now its around the middle of 9th grade.

I finally think I learned from my experiences and having yet gained more maturity. A girl named Katlyn (hiding her real name) found me and we started texting, we have met before but I didn't even realize and our parents were colleagues. anyway
We were friends with her for a rew months, I didn't really have feelings for her but she did as she had later told me (wayy later), I started developing feelings for her whennwe started texting more and at first we were really similar.
I promised I would be a different person this time and I was, I held to my word, We started out relationship and it was lovely, really lovely. It didn't hit hard as first love but it was something deeper something else. 
She then started doing volunteering in the summer break. That's when the cracks and her problems started showing, she was overly unhealthily ambitious, she was often disregarding me and people, she was cold and distant but I was warm and patient. She treated all people like engagments and was incredibly distant from idea of compassion due to her traumas and anxieties oreventing her from having healthy friendships and more, things were getting worse and she broke up with me because she was feeling stressed and wanted to let me be free as she knew she couldn't be a good partner. We spend two weeks as friends and at the end of the second week we starred talking and talking, I was getting to her with my words and she realized her mistake. We got back together, she was better, we were better things were nicer and more stable. I helped her with her own personality issues.

Everything was perfect, we were doing amazing we were getting so close and so together, we bonded, we felt and functioned like one.

Few months down the road I started seeing a lot of difference in character and so did she. We thought we were similare but we had different opinions and we realized we werekind of different.
We still loved each other a lot, we had a lot of trust and love built and went through a lot of struggles together.

Eventually tho those difference's were becoming a bit much to me, I would often have the same states of anger and fear yet again short damaging and unexplained.
I hate myself for that but some of the differences really hurt sometimes as you wouldn't be able to share something you love with them.

Despite that we were still a good and connected couple but those states of mine started causing problems, she also started slipping into a bit of old habits, I had trust issues from before and she broke up with me again.
I felt of doing it a day before but decided that this was too much to throw away and that it could work.
We were both literally nothing without each other.

This is as of time of writing this one month ago.

I said some stuff I didn't want to say to her after we broke up out of fear and confusion and anxiety. She did too. We caused problem's in our relations not as partners but as really close people. It hurts
My das got covid at that time and was at his death bed, he told me he would die as the dictors have said so and I didn't know how to handle all that, it felt like my world wasveing crushed into infinite pieces.

By god's grace my dad survived.
My relations with my now ex continue to get worse and better and worse yet again. She still cares for me and I do too but she is incredibly, incredibly distant from me because of the exchanged stuff after our breakup.
I have no one to turn to fir help or advice
My mother currently has severe ocd and panic attacks.

I don't know what to do. I still want her back and I want everything to be okay but I know it wouldn't

On top of that I forgot to say when I turn 18 I will inherit a 500k debt from my father.

Trying to work on my future, trying to study, trying to fight my depression, trying to get a girlfriend, all these things, taking life so serious, working so hard -> yup I ended up in a very big burn-out. Ive always been a hard worker but now I have absolutely no energy to do anything. I quit studying, im not gonna look for a job any time soon, im not gonna move out of my parents house or else I would be homeless and not even care enough to get myself out of that situation. I dont brush my teeth I dont eat healthy I dont go outside I dont shower - FUCK THAT SHIT BECAUSE IVE BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS AND I STILL ENDED UP LIKE THIS NOW SO WHATS THE POINT

 The only thing im capable of doing is playing videogames and sleeping 24/7. How do I have energy for videogames? 1. they dont stress me out 2. I need something to do or else I stare at the wall all day dying from being so bored

The last few months ive only been playing videogames 24/7, ruining my health, trying to survive life and nothing else. FUCK THIS LIFE BECAUSE I NEVER ASKED TO BE BORN HERE. Does God really want me to be thankful because im in this life full of suffering?

Its over. Im physically sick and mentally sick. Im not getting better and even if so many people try no one can really help me.

Whats the point in surviving if I cant even enjoy videogames but still have to play them to not be bored to death.

On paper, it seems like I should be content with myself and my life. I am grateful for what I have but I feel like there is a void within me that disables me from being happy.

1954,"My mind is a warzone, I can't find peace.  I need to talk to someone, but I'm not comfortable talking to the people closest to me so I'm hoping that someone on here understands what I feel.

I'm a guy, 17 years old, I recently started medication and also started getting counseling for my problems with focus and anxiety, counselor says that I have ADHD and generalized anxiety. I'm not on medication for my anxiousness but I am on medication for my trouble focusing.

I am near constantly pacing around I can't stop it, the worst part is that I've just wasted away so much of my life walking back and forth for hours on end. I HAVE to walk a specific route in a specific way as well, I don't know what compels me to do it, it's more like a subconscious thing rather than obsessive thoughts that are making me do it that way. I don't like it at all but I need to move or else my thoughts will completely overwhelm me, in fact I'm pacing right now as I type this.

I feel as though I'm trapped in my own mind and unable to escape, causing me to have severe mental, emotional, and physical exhaustion. Often times I find that I have wasted the day away having done absolutely nothing productive. I know that I have skills and I know that I can achieve great things but I just can't break this stupid cycle, I actually want to do so many things but I just don't have enough time to do them especially when I do this to myself.

Physically, my heart starts beating faster than normal and I begin to sweat especially at my palms, of course I can't stop moving my legs and It's like a can't get enough oxygen or fresh air.

Socially, I've locked myself away from people, I do still talk to other people but for the most part it's just petty small talk, casual conversation, cracking some jokes, or sometimes just showing them a meme that I thought was funny. People that I used to have good relations with, have either drifted away from me or I pushed them away. I swear to God I had more close friends in elementary school than I do now, now It's mostly just acquaintances and both of my best friends are family members (my brother and cousin in law). Outside of family there isn't anyone I would consider ""family"".

Emotionally, It's the hardest for me, I'm so overwhelmed with conflicting thoughts and emotions that it's difficult for me to even be honest with how I feel to myself. When my mom asks about how I feel I get irritated because honestly I DON'T KNOW how I feel or I just feel like I don't feel anything, as if I'm an apathetic ghost.

Exactly like flipping a coin, without any sort of trigger, totally at random, I will feel either A: ""back to the same routine"", emotionally cold, stuck in my head, and I will have no interest or pleasure in things that normally make me feel good. Or B, I feel the exact opposite: ""today's gonna be different"", much more sensitive to others, freed from my thoughts/able to focus, and most of all I have so much confidence I feel as though I'm completely unstoppable.

Worst of all though, the guilt that I have is really tearing away at me. I try to move past the mistakes I've made in the past to forgive myself but I continually get reminded of them. Mostly, I'm reminded of the people I pushed away and how I may have hurt them, how I may have impacted them.

My personality definitely doesn't help, I would say that I come off as incredibly boring to others, my emotional coldness and insensitivity does not help at all when trying to communicate with them.",Relaxed

I can't remember ever feeling like I actually enjoy living. I've always thought that being dead was a much better option. I've even attempted killing myself 3 times when I was a teenager, twice by swallowing all the pills I had at home, once by cutting my wrist. It failed all three times because the pills weren't strong enough and it was too physically painful to cut deep enough.

I am unable to form deep and lasting relationships, probably due to lacking the ability to empathize with others. When it comes to other people, I am incapable of love and closeness and therefore am quite certain that is something I will never have in my life, even though I would like to. What I am very much capable of on the other hand is envy, anger and hate, which is eating me up from the inside, but as much as I've tried, I simply cannot overcome them.

Sure, I've had a few brief good and successful moments in my life, but I always, ALWAYS end up where I am right now - miserable and hating the fact that my heart is still beating. I'm just sick of the constant struggle. The few good moments just aren't worth it and I would give them all up without a second thought for a chance to end my existance quickly, painlessly and peacefully.

1966,"Looking for peace and guidance  I don't want to bore you with all of the details, so I'll try to keep it brief and readable.
I'm a 56 year old male and deal with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and dissociative disorder I think from the PTSD. I've been working for over 40 years in various fields. In fact, you probably wouldn't believe how many different jobs I've had. A sampling would include making pizza, landscaping, electrician, commercial printer, job estimator, machinist, and automatic door tech. I have excelled at all of the jobs, WORK wise. I just can't seem to get along with people no matter what methods I try. I go to the job, take it seriously and do the best I can. Most times I'm able to do the job at a journeyman level in very short order. Coworkers start screwing with me or sabotaging my work, bosses will either hate me, or pile as much shit work on me as possible so the rest of the staff can stand around doing as little as possible.
Now when I was younger and my dissociative disorder was much worse, a glimpse of my crazy would back people way off. However, as you can imagine, this made people afraid of me and management leery of me. Not what I wanted. All I wanted was to work and be treated fairly. With hypnotherapy and counselling the DD is in control, but I still can't function properly
With the DD, I feel like I'm from another planet, or at least, another timeline. I can relate to some people. I've never had issues finding a mate, or friends if I put an effort into it. I have a wonderful wife of 12 years who understands my crazy. Friends, though, not many at all. They just turn out to be trouble, or I feel like they're using me. Example, "" Oh hey, why not swing by this evening? Bring your tools, my dishwasher is making funny noises"" Like I'm just eagerly awaiting someone to need me. Pay me? Hell  no, we're friends! Or they think I'm a counselor. I'm good with listening/discussion of problems. I'm kinda good at it and happy to for good friends. But if I have a problem, or something is breaking my heart, no one has time or can't be bothered. So, friends have fallen to the side over the past 25 years or so until there aren't any left. I'm damn near terrified of making new friends. 
My issue with ""friends"" keeps me distant on the job, too. This seems to give the impression I think that I'm better. Nothing could be further from the truth. I think I'm the same piece of crap everyone else is. I don't have a high view of humanity, but hardly think I'm better. Anyway, I'll be left out of conversations, company functions, etc, but if I don't invite these strangers to my life functions? What an asshole! 
Right now, I'm unemployed. I quit my job about a month ago and working on things around the house. The anxiety and stress of the job wasn't worth the number of hours I'd get or the yelling sessions I'd have to endure for asking a question or wondering if there was more work. 
I do feel better, but I either have to find a job that A. I won't be treated like shit or lied to; B. Won't stress me out; C. Will make me feel like I'm doing something worthwhile; D. I get paid decently.
Or
Go down that long road to get full social security disability.

It's not worth my already low energy. I can't gain the courage to fail and be rejected anymore it just hurts. I don't need more pain. Either I am alone forever, or somehow a few words from a therapist will be any different than all the advice I've heard online that will convince me to get over that fear of rejection that feels like you're supposed to jump out of a plane by yourself.

1968,"I can feel the sense of peace and content leaving me throughout the day  Does anyone else experience this? Unless I'm having a particularly bad day I normally wake up in the morning, and I feel as though I have a ""full capacity"" to enjoy things. Even if it's just the walk to work or browsing on my computer or even something I don't particularly want to do. The point is that I can focus my energy and do it, and not only draw from the pool of motivation, but also feel immersed in the task, and then after, content and fulfilled. But throughout the day these capacities leave in increments. My brain gets more and more frantic and moves in different directions, but can't settle in one. Sometimes it feels like I only ""do things"" to get them over with to get to the end of the day. 

For example, yesterday I got home from work. I knew I was in the mood to read. But when I started to read, I couldn't focus. I couldn't draw any satisfaction from the task. I get disappointed and angry with myself. I kept thinking what should I do? What should I do? It's 6. 6:30. 7. When's an acceptable time to just get high and lay down?  
Before I started taking SSRIs it was worse. During quarantine I would wake up in the morning and my brain would start working in 8 directions before I could even sit down to read or cook in peace. I felt frantic, and depleted. Unsatisfied.

Being with other people helps but I think it's mostly because they are a distraction. My anxiety is heightened around people so when I get home to be alone, it feels like a relief, a reward, and I can enjoy solitude because it's fresh again.

For context I just moved to a different country so I know these things are heightened, but I've been experiencing this sensation of ""depleted contentedness/satisfaction/motivation"" for a long time.",Relaxed

1974,"I have been exploring the idea of a 'simple solution' to achieve peace of mind and mental stability. Here it is.  While meditating today and trying to deal with my usual whirlwind of unpleasant thoughts in my mind, it suddenly occurred to me that there might be a simple solution to all mental peace. Right or wrong, I have been searching for a 'master key', something that could definitively restore balance to my mind (I have suffered from psychosis for the last 8 months) and I think this might be it:

The complete lack of an opinion. It suddenly appeared to me that the instability of my mind was linked to my constantly having an opinion regarding my state of mind - my dissatisfaction drove me to overthink in my quest to 'fix myself'. But then, during my meditation, I tried simply not having an opinion at all. It only took a few seconds and utterances of ""have no opinion, have no judgement"" and boom. That was it. My mind was suddenly quiet. For the next hour I wondered in amazement, stared at walls and marveled at the absolute nothingness I was experiencing. It was like my mind accepted that this was the solution I had been searching for, and it complied in the application of having no opinion. Whereas before there was a struggle to dampen the chaos and find peace, there was now peace and silence, my mind confidently allowing itself not to have an opinion on anything at all, perfectly able to sit and stare at a random part of my room, with only the faintest of thoughts coming to the surface, and even briefly at that unless I decided I wanted to think.

Earlier on in life,  I‚Äôve always informed everyone I dealt with that their words and promises are like contracts to me. And so is mine. So when someone says that they‚Äôll do something, I go on in life knowing they‚Äôll live by that word/promise. I‚Äôve never defaulted on my words/promises. 

This has reduced the stress in my life. Especially completing a dual undergrad + a minor. And definitely while completing my PhD on time. Because I didn‚Äôt have to worry about things that others have promised they will complete.

During the entire time, I had my own back. And tried very hard to never tie my future/accomplishments/goals to be dependent on anyone.

The few times people have broken their promises/words to me, and it had affected my current lifestyle and/or set me back in my goals,
I‚Äôve definitely not handled it well. I‚Äôve yelled, just screened at them, and called them names like: worthless, untrustworthy, immature, irresponsible, etc. You can say I have a real anger management issue during this time.

I want to do better. I know calling them names is hurtful, and I want to avoid that. 

How can I avoid that? I just said I wouldn‚Äôt depend on them anymore. But they say that‚Äôs also hurtful. But why should I care that their feelings are hurt because I don‚Äôt want to depend on them when they‚Äôve let me down in the past?

It really feels like they want me to never be upset or express it or just feel my emotions and let them be, i always have to try and get rid of them or micromanage it so I don‚Äôt get upset. 

Doing that has never helped. I don‚Äôt like constantly thinking about how I feel or doing everything I can to not get upset.

It's been just two days and I'm already feeling suffocated. My parents are loving and caring, and since I suffered from a serious health blow, they are pampering me a lot. Since I was away for 5 years, my room is not set up at all, and will take a couple more days for the same (bed and desk and chair). So right now I'm staying in the common shared space with my parents, and they are always, ALWAYS around me. I don't have any space. 
But that's okay, I know it's temporary and they love me. But the worst part is I'm getting drained out and cranky. My parents are ALWAYS talking...either on the phone or to each other or to me. And when they aren't talking, the television is on. My house isn't silent except for when they are sleeping late at night. It's making me crazy!!!! I just want to tell them to shut up because I need silence. I can't possibly do that, it will hurt their feelings. They are old people, who are just extremely excited that I am home and i understand their sentiments too. 
But it's really starting to hurt me. I can't concentrate. Most of the time I'm wearing my noise cancellation headphones and putting on loud music so I can tune out their voices. But that's giving me a headache. 
How can I survive this? 
I don't have the option to go to a different room or part of the house due to constraints. I can't go outside due to covid lockdown. And they NEVER STOP TALKING! And they are suffocating me. It's always noisy and I just need some silence üò≠üò≠

1984,"Nightmare Disorder  Hey y‚Äôall, I (24F) never realized it but I meet the criteria for ‚Äúnightmare disorder.‚Äù It is to the point where the sleep deprivation and nightmares in general affect my psychosocial interaction. My boyfriend says he hears me cry and make scared sounds in my sleep every night, keeping him awake as well. This has been going on for several years but has gotten extremely worse the last 6 months.

1985,"A good nights sleep is critical to your mental health - if you find yourself lying awake, a little meditation before bed can help you find peaceful, refreshing sleep  Insomnia can have a hugely detrimental effect on your mental health, especially if you regularly miss sleep. When we lie awake at night, we can frequently have stressful thoughts that prevent us from relaxing enough to drop off - meditating before bedtime can help to accept and let go of these difficult thoughts and feelings. Reducing caffeine and screen time along with regular mindfulness practice can help you sleep peacefully and have happier days.

1998,"For all my life I've been talking to myself out loud, usually with different voices in my head which are really just subdivisions of my feelings and behaviors. Today I stopped talking to them and I feel extraordinarily calm and at peace with myself.  I don't know how to make the title make sense, but, that's the best I could do.

I would hear each personality, for which I've given grandiose names that you would no doubt cringe at hearing and entire fantastical backstories to them and why they just so happen to coincidentally reside up in my head (alongside by very own self reflective character) and communicate out loud to them as if they could hear me and moreover had to hear me in order to respond, (even though they're in my head) about all sorts of things in the way of  guidance. I guess it's a similar feeling I would imagine to speaking to a loved one you ""still see"" after they're gone.

Anyways, to the point, tonight I was particularly stressed and neurotic, unable to sleep and worried about the future to no end, and followed by that was just me going on and on trying to rationalize and find answers I couldn't possibly find about how everything's fine and I'm doing enough and I need to stop stressing.

After about 10 minutes of pacing, I just decided to stop completely. Just stop saying anything at all. Just me and myself, or so I think, I guess I'm still not sure whether or not this ""myself"" is just the same as any of the other personalities I was ""communicating"" with prior. Anyways, As a result of such practices I've felt remarkably calm and at peace. Everything seems eerily calm and fine; though nothing changed besides me not speaking out loud (to nobody at all).

I would think that I have an internal dialogue as I'm thinking about the right words to articulate this post right now, so it really boggles me that this makes any difference at all, but I'm just glad that I'm more relaxed. I guess I kind of shut out those concerns symbollically in my head sense that's the association I've developed with them over the past 10 or so years. Kind of skipped the whole no more imaginary friends phase of life if you couldn't already tell.

Anyways I just wanted to post about it because I thought it was, and is still an interesting and certainly positive experience. It really does lead me to believe we have to learn to traverse our very own constructs, and maybe beyond archytpically nobody else can do that for us. We've designed how we individually think, maybe not to a large scale but atleast somewhat, and with that maybe we can navigate how we feel, why we feel that way, and/or how to stop feeling a certain way.

In retrospect after writing up this whole mumbo jumbo I'm realizing this is basically a largely oversimplified explanation of psychology via dreams. Truly interesting stuff.

2000,"I‚Äôm a burden for having burdens.  Does anyone else feel this way?

I'm exhausted. I have been diagnosed with OCD, c-PTSD, ADHD, recurrent depression, generalized anxiety, and high-masking autism. It took me 18 years to get diagnosed even though I started showing symptoms at five years.

I feel like I ruin everything‚Äîfor others & for myself. I can't enjoy the things I want to, because my psychiatric conditions hold me back. I'm constantly fighting panic attacks and intrusive thoughts while keeping up appearances on the outside. It's tiring. I hate wearing a mask all the time to keep those around me happy, while I silently die inside.

I'm on an international trip right now, but I can't bring myself to enjoy it. My OCD always flares up when I travel, and my AuDHD brain doesn't tolerate change well at all. On top of that, I experienced a traumatic event while traveling back in 2019. So to say it took a lot of courage to come on this trip is an understatement. But I wanted to come. I wanted to be here‚Äîso badly‚Äîbecause I don't want these chronic mental illnesses keeping me from living life to the fullest. From enjoying precious moments with my husband and my family. 

But my body and my brain can't tolerate being here. I break down and cry to husband who has to incessantly console me to the best of his ability, wearing him down. I struggle to keep a positive attitude and end up acting like a grouch because my mind is in overdrive. My panic attacks cause us to miss out on things on our itinerary, which disappoints my husband and causes my mind to reinforce that I‚Äôm a burden to him and always will be. He‚Äôs never said that, but I‚Äôve always believed it, because how am I not a burden? I can see his attempts to hide his disappointment and impatience, not only on trips, but within our daily lives. I hate myself for it. 

I go on these trips full of joy and expectation for all the new possibilities I‚Äôm bound to experience‚Äîwith anxious thoughts and feelings of premeditated defeat and sadness lingering in the background. The latter always wins. Every minor inconvenience or growing feeling of panic sends me into an inward ‚ÄúI told you it would end up like this‚Äîwhen will you ever learn‚Äù spiral.

I don't know how to use the bus lines and no one around me knows how to either, but I'm planning on asking a social worker whenever I can but idk when that will be.

I work 6 minutes away but it's a couple of miles so I can't walk and my school Is a couple of miles away so I can walk, well I guess I theoretically could. Would that be unrealistic? 

I can't ask my parents for anything like an extra ride to pick up my medications (but my medications cannot be delivered so I end up just not picking them uphalf the time) every month I beg my mom for a ride to get them because the pharmacy is 3 miles away.

If I got a bike I know that shit will get stolen.  on a part time job and I already struggle working part time with school anyway, so working full time and school will kill me. 

I already struggle with being able to function and wake up everyday, and with taking care of myself. I haven't brushed my teeth in 2 weeks. 
 If I work full time at my job i will make about $2,400 a month before taxes and because I know I wouldn't be able to survive on my own without multiple jobs anyway that's why I haven't worked full time yet. 

I'm trying to get jobs in walking distance but no one is hiring me. My bed has been broken for 6 months and I can't even go to sleep. If it's not one thing it's another. I am so tired of existing.

2015,"My poor grades have been such a burden to me.  I was always a 'smart kid' if you could say. I was kind of rebellious but I was told what to do by my parents academically. I attended KUMON (I know not the most optimal, but it wasn't too bad) every Tuesday, and did comprehension and math exceeded from my current school level.

Got A's and B's on my report cards, my teachers told my parents that I was usually well-behaved, focus on my work, had a great personality and was exceeding in my academics. During that I loved myself, I was very proud of myself. I was negligent of all the world's problems, like a typical child.

But from 5th - 6th grade, it was like a goddamn downward spiral. I suddenly neglected self care, skipped showering, brushing my teeth, had shitty sleep schedule, and multiple other destructive habits I wish I hadn't engaged. I was more shy, and was deeply self-loathing. And so my studying concentration and schedule were affected extremely.

Last Christmas, I am now in 7th grade. Academics got more tiring and more difficult to handle. During primary school, I would be helped by my mother for the tests, and/or studied independently. Now I was entirely studying by myself, and from my hand-written notes. And guess what, I was a lazy slut. I secretly played video games all day rather than studying, still neglected self-care, and I f\*cking hated that, I hated all of that, I wish I could go back, but the damage was done.

I got A's, but now with C's and D's. My parents were extremely upset and also shocked, and we had such a massive argument, and all of my self-esteem was destroyed, and my mother compared me to a succesful and happy person, and also said that 'at least he loved his mother and father'.

I was emotionally scarred by that. Although the yelling I thought was pretty unnecessarily overreacted, they were right. I had failed on the only thing I excelled at. I was a burden. I depicted myself as a failure. As a younger kid, I knew I was always good at my school, and so I worked hard to impress others on multiple skills, now I couldn't even keep up with my grades. I was really a failure.

December to February, I deeply self-loathed myself, I was confused. I was such a 'bright' kid, I was a kid to happily talk to, a funny and dignified kid, a kid to have fun. And now I still have a bunch of self-destructive behaviours, and I still didn't practise any self-care. All those problems just made my self-hatred worse. I now needed additional tutors and extra studying everyday (I thought it was pretty unusual and pretty extreme for such mediocre grades), but I couldn't concentrate in those as well, as my self-loathing problem was still heavily affecting my studying, probably even worse. And to top it off, I hated that I was so mentally immature.

I don't know, I just felt like such a burden to my parents, to my siblings. To my uncles, and to my cousins. To everyone I tried to impress, I was a joke. I nitpicked every tiny and to the most deep gut-wrenching memories, and focused on all the bad things I have done.

It still can't get better. I tried to practise more healthy habits, but they were either too ineffective, or were broken early to even be regulated. I feel like I am wasting every second of my life, every second I did waste of my life. I don't want this to continue to college, that is like a time-bomb waiting to explode.

I admit a big part of where I am coming from stems from my own insecurities. In many ways I have things pretty 'easy'; I have a wide array of very close friends, and do pretty well on the dating front. I am not 'Autistic' in hte conventional sense.... BUT in every way, these traits manifest themselves. I have some absolutely bizarre sexual fetishes, as well as the fact I do suffer from extreme bouts of sensory overload in any busy public place. I have some unhealthy obsessions with sinister subjects such as Eugenics, and still 'flap' my hands at the age of 24. I am particularly insecure about table manners, because I am extremely clumsy and find eating with a knife and fork, still, to be incredibly difficult. I see other people who can just seemlessly eat a meal, very tidily.  
I wish I was just another boring, plain, 'cog-in-the-machine' rather than the extremely eccentric individual that I am. I also suffer from bipolar disorder, whereby my moods/mindsets are ridiculously temperemental. I can go from being the most happy, go-lucky, chill, extroverted person  ever, to a misanthropic, bitter, angry individual, one who exhibits lots of violent, sinister, tyrannical thoughts (whereby I envision the world as 'chaotic' and it is up to my own arrogant self to 'organise' it).",Stressed
2019,"I stress my family out and feel like a burden  For context, I am a 19 year old woman who still lives at home with parents. These past two years, my life has fallen apart, and I am struggle to find the motivation to improve myself. During my senior year of high school, my best friend and I grew apart after doing our junior year online due to Covid. It sucked because they were my only friend and without them, I was alone. On top of that, I was struggling to stay motivated in school and was stressed out a lot.

Fast forward to freshman year of college, things were going fine initially. I was doing fine in my classes, but struggled to make friends. Then, the coursework ended up multiplying and it lead to me having a mental breakdown and then taking a leave of absence. I also had the same outcome back in the Fall of 2023. Ultimately, I dropped out of college because I figured out it wasn‚Äôt for me.

Thus, now I am trying to figure my life out. I have been working at a family business for the past two years but hate it. I only took the job because I wanted to figure out what other options I had. I did find a career path that I am interested in, which involves animals. However, I still continue to suffer from depression and feel like a waste of space.

Lately, I have been reminiscing about high school, and my old friendship. I used to be a promising student and had a small social circle. However, I have fallen so far since and am a failure. I have failed my family as a daughter and feel like an embarrassment. I have always had trouble making friends and feel unworthy. On top of that, I made a big mistake yesterday while driving that is killing me. For me, driving is a way to establish independence, but I feel like such an idiot. 

Today, I had bad anxiety thinking about what could come of my mistake, as I am unsure if I would receive a ticket or not. During my anxiety attack, my parents told me that I stress them out, and they‚Äôre right. I am a huge burden to everyone around me and sometimes, I feel like they would be better off without me. I have dealt with severe mental health issues since middle school, and they have faced more challenges with me. My brother also had his own struggles, but nothing compared to me. He is successful, has plans for his life, a girlfriend, and happiness. I feel like the defective child. Honestly, the thought of suicide just crosses my mind sometimes. I hate that I exist.

The dude's great, I consider him a sorts of a big brother.

Now, for some context. We're travelling to my dad's country now and they're (my sister and her husband) are making plans to go to Japan, but I have no money (though I saved and bought a new computer that I need in order to be able to code and make games, I want to start in that Field and needed a good machine to do so), I mean, I have what you'd say is ""just enough"" money to cover plane tickets, and stay but then due to my financial situation not being good, I don't think I'd be able to afford like... Going to places and eating at restaurants. And since my sister is doing well, like I said, she's stsrting her own company and got married already, she's in quite a healthy relationship, and I'm not, I haven't achieved anything, no company, no business, no girlfriend (and no prospects either), I'm a fucking failure.  

Every project I have started fails, and I have not been able to get a decent job and working only shitty jobs in my home country. 

I feel like I will achieve nothing and have achieved nothing, and therefore I'm a burden to my family. I think everyone would be better if I'm gone. I think. 

I have been having ideas to disappear and maybe even kill myself but those thoughts are just ideas and I entertain them, but I am sure I won't carry out either. I'm just nothing, and don't matter. 

Guess I'm mostly venting here... Back in my home coutnry I was training martial arts so I was able to let some shit out but here I feel I'll explode.

I just feel like all I am is a burden. No one understands my OCD and they don‚Äôt care how badly it effects me. My OCD is all about cleanliness around my hands, face, and belongings, with my biggest triggers being oil and butter. 

My anxiety got so bad I had to drop out of high school. I have no friends and I‚Äôm so lonely. Sometimes I want to kill myself just to be rid of these things, and sometimes I want to kill myself because I think everyone would be better off without me.

I did not come from a good home at all. My parents split when I was pretty young (4) and since then it‚Äôs slowly fell apart at home. My mum married an awful, fucking awful man with an awful family that made me feel like a burden for the way I am. They shouted at me for feeling anxious or crying.

My mum is volatile. She has mental issues and has even blamed me for causing them. A few times in the last few years she has ‚Äòsnapped‚Äô where she would scream and cry at me. It was terrifying. It happened today and I feel so scared I don‚Äôt even want to be in the same room as her.

I feel helpless. I'm determined to just put on a happy face front, and be miserable inside until I can finally get into see a therapist.",Stressed
2047,"I (25M) fear that I am burdening my senior coworker (28F).  I've been a constant overthinker and an extremely lonely guy. My trusted coworker is helping me for 3 months to overcome this habit. She herself used to be an overthinker and anxious all the time. We are working together for more than 1 year now. 3 months ago, when she realized some issue I was facing in the office and i was so anxious about it, she gave me 40 minutes pep talk and it was really helpful and soothing for me. From last 3 months,we started to get open about personal and family issues. I shared about my strained relations with my father and how it's affecting me mentally. So 3 weeks back, my parents had a huge fight and my mother and sister went to her brother's house for a few days. I was left alone with my dad. I had a full nervous breakdown and panic attack, I called her and she picked up. She calmed me down and shared some of her bad experiences as well. We talked for 1 hour. Last Monday, i had a panic attack during office hours. After panic attack, i was really numb throughout the day and i had difficulty collecting words. Next morning, i told her about that. She encouraged me to forget about my parent's fight and also asked me to make peace with my decision of leaving the toxic friend circle which is the main reason I am lonely these months. I shared my fears and issues which can be the reason i am having panic attacks in last 3 months. Whenever i share my issues with her and I vent and cry it out, after our talk, i feel better.

2049,"I feel like a burden  VENTING + NEED SUPPORT + TRIGGER WARNING 


I feel like a burden. It's so tiring to live like I do every single day. I hate saying that though, bc I feel like others do have it worse. I don't want to invalidate my feelings either, but I feel worthless.

I suffer from an ED (ARFID) and it makes my life hell. To that, I have several anxiety disorders. I'm not scared of gaining weight, but I'm severely underweight. I WANT to gain weight so badly, but due to pseudodysphagia (+ phagophobia = fear of swallowing that turned into chronic mental dysphagia) I barely eat the calories in my daily calorie plan, and I have a fast metabolism. It sucks a lot. 

Lately I've also been having gastrointestinal problems. One day I'll go from constipation to diarrhea in the next day, and at night time I get heatburn and feel nauseous. I also have diagnosed emetophobia, so when I get nauseous, I panic, and when I panic, the nausea gets worse and it's this hell cycle. I went to the doctor w/ constipation and she gave me laxatives. It got so bad, that I even went to the hospital, and she also just gave me meds etc. and it got better. My aunt is a pharmacist and nutritionist, so I go to her for helping me gain weight. We want to sit together to make me a full meal plan. (Bg info: My family as always been on the skinny side). She also recommend some things to help with my stomach problems that I'm trying out right now. But it sucks and it's hard. 

I really need a therapist and I've been on the waiting list since October 2021, but it isn't going well, so we will try any other ones around, but almost all places are taken or they are not for kids/teens (I'm 14F).

So with my anxiety, I have specific phobias (mentioned above) but now I got kinda scared of sleeping or being alone in general, in case something happens to me, or I need to puke etc. I sleep in the living room, bc my room is kinda further away from my mom's room (my brother already sleeps in my mom's room, so I can't) and I just cry and cry and cry because I'm desperate. I think my mom is fed up with it. She knows that I just panic. Whenever I have a minor symptom, I immediately go full on panic mode and imagine that I have the worst illnesses possible (like cancer or a heart attack when my chest feels tight) but I know that almost all of these symptoms are because of the severe anxiety :( I just keep spiralling, especially at night. Whenever I cry, my mom sighs in like a ""here we go again"" tone, and it makes me cry even more. What's worse? My brother LAUGHING about it, even though he has several anxiety disorders HIMSELF and the reason he sleeps in my mom's room, is the same as mine. But since I'm the big sister, I have to suck it up. It makes me sob even more to the point where I just want to kill myself. I don't know how much longer I can do this. I want therapy so bad, but it just isn't available for me right now, though my family is doing everything to support me. 


TRIGGER WARNING FOR THIS PARAGRAPH:

It's worth mentioning that I was in a mental hospital. They got me to a stable weight, but mentally I wasn't doing progress at all. There was drama with my roommates, and I just wasn't having it. I literally started self harming when I was there, so it didn't help at all. When they saw scars, they just said that it isn't deep enough to do anything. My sick mind took that as a challenge and I think you know where this goes on from now. I don't want to go back there, ever. I was at my worst there. I know it was necessary, but they force fed me, and even I knew it was in an unhealthy way. They fed me all kinds of chocolate etc. but fat weight doesn't do much. I couldn't even build up muscle, since I wasn't allowed to walk a lot. 

I also suspect that I may have ocd, and it has been going on for YEARS until I found out what ocd (specifically pure o) was, due to the stigma around it. My brother also has diagnosed ocd, so I think it wouldn't be unusual. 

I'm just scared that I have ""too many"" diagnosis, and I hate self diagnosing, but it brings me steps closer to an actual one :(  

My actual diagnosis (from the MH) are:
* Non specific ED (possibly ARFID)
* specific phobias (emetophobia, phagophobia)
* adjustment disorder
* depressive episodes

* mental dysphagia (doctor diag.)

And my suspected extra diagnosis are:

* OCD
* hypochondriac / health anxiety

And yeah. Also, if you're wondering how I didn't get diagnosed with OCD in the first place is bc I didn't talk about my intrusive thoughts/obsessions or my compulsions there, since I didn't even know what ocd was, and I thought it was just people who liked things clean (stigma). I also felt ashamed for intrusive thoughts and since my ED was the main focus, I just never talked about it. I don't know where I'm going with this long rant.

If you read everything, I'm truly thankful. I just feel like I'm a burden and it would be better if I was dead bc then I wouldn't have to deal with this anymore. I feel like I may have TOO MANY mental disorders, and will never be able to get through all of them. I can't see a light at the end of the tunnel and I'm slowly giving up hope. I want to keeo fighting, but I feel so weak... Honestly I just think about dying, so I wouldn't be a burden with my Problems to my family.

2050,"I feel like a Burden to my wife - Dealing with Major Depression  So.. I've been struggling with Major depression since I was a child and didn't get treatment for it up until this year. I've been in very dark places and was totally miserable, wasn't able to even pick up the phone when my mom called and I had to quit multiple jobs because I couldn't get out of my bed and stop crying. 

My beloved wife has been with me throughout everything  since we met, she's always been my strongest support system and never ever complained for dealing with me and the things I couldn't do for myself. Since starting medication and therapy I've been reflecting about the past and seeing her struggling in silence because I wasn't strong enough, just broke me.  There's been so many times where she struggled in silence and made herself look stronger and like she could save me and everything would be okay, but, I know that she's changed since I met her, she stopped going to college because she had so much on her head and developed anxiety and I know I'm the reason.

Her parents always tell her that she should've never left their home and live with me and that she would probably be a professional now if she would've stayed under their roof while she studied. And.. I feel like their right, I'm such a failure and I was so miserable during our first years living together. For context, we're 22 and met in HS, left our parents house when we were 18. 

My point is.. I just can't get the thought out of my head about her being so much happier, healthier and successful If I've never crossed her life, she always was the girl with all the A+ and Honor classes and there I came to her life and become a burden... I will talk to my therapist about this feeling I have but I also asked my wife to see a therapist too, I feel like she need to let herself feel emotions and stop pretending to be strong, and heal all the hurt I have caused....

I don't even know how to start making it up to her, I feel like I make her lose so much time and God I love her with my life, and I know she loves me too, she's the reason I'm here, the only reason why I never took my life, even though I planned it and was so ready..

I just want to be a better person, a good person for her, and be the anchor she need me to be, just like she's been to me these past years..",Stressed

2052,"I feel like a walking burden to my family and people I care about.  Uhm hi.I feel ridiculous partially just writing this or saying it but I feel like my family my boyfriend wouldnt understand. In july I had back to back hospital visits and surgeries while visiting my boyfriend. He was supportive of me and then my mom eventually came down my injuries and what not were really severe and life threathening. My first injury alone I broke my ankle really bad and couldnt walk I cried calling my mom and telling her because I felt so horrible. I knew how expensive paramedic services can be I didnt want to cause them anymore debt. I'm a college student with crippling ADHD and anxiety im fairly young, and as of right now im still on my parents health insurance. I've been trying to get my life together and its embarrasing how much others have accomplished in comparison to me. Breaking my ankle meant numerous hospital and doctors visits, two surgeries and lots of medical bills. I just got cleared recently to be able to walk again which I was happy about. And my parents have been wanting me to get a job to help pay the bills. My boyfriend is also depending on me to get a job with a paycheck so we can use those paystubs to show proof of payment for the apartment we are trying to get in my name, (and he pays idk in some ways I feel so out of touch and lost not intentionally but I just do). Unfortunately I am close to finishing my degree it wouldn't be until next year in the spring if things go well. But I have no job experience my parents didnt want me working at all while I was in school I used to offer to get a job and even tried to but my mom kinda withheld my ssi infocard i needed and other stuff I needed to do the job. (But thats a story for another day). But I am lacking a SEVERE amount of job experience. Like very severe as in I only have two jobs I really documented as working, I have experience with some jobs but I didn't stay long enough for it to count. So next to no one will really take a chance on me because they look at my resume and it makes me look so inexperienced. But jobs that require hard labor might consider hiring me but I only just started walking in my boot not too long ago. I can't even walk down a flight of steps normally or go up some stairs for that matter. My ankle is still pretty weak and to be able to stand for 10-12 hour shifts like that I have tried to push my body before like through job interviews I had recently where I would be watching kids the time I would be watching kids is short so the money isnt great. I still try to apply for jobs even though my experience is just not what it needs to be on paper. Alot of places just haven't been willing to take a chance on me. So getting to the part you probably came here for...(„Å£ ¬∫–î¬∫)„Å£ Ô∏µ ‚å®
I feel like Im a huge burden medically on my parents. My mom has been getting really upset with me over little things that I try to do right at with the right intentions but I end up messing up. Everytime I mess up I can hear this feeling of disappointment in her voice. Trying to be nice to my mom I told her I loved her in text because she wasnt home. I also kind of blurted out that my toe has an ingrown toenail and with part of my nail coming off from some cheap amazon shoes i bought to wear at a club (with socks of course) I lost part of my nail it got detateched and now my toe is hurting really bad and its sore idk it might be infected. And I told her and my dad about it for advice because I tried getting it out myself but the tools I have won't let me reach far enough down. When I told my mom about it, she said to me with a dissappointed tone, ""you may need surgery for it"" and  ""I wish you said something about it earlier"".All you can do is call the doctor and set an appointment and pray for no more bills. The problem is fairly recent it wasnt an issue at the time I was at the hospital. My mom couldnt say I love you too she said because there was just alot going on for her and I just know that my hospital bills are the cause of her stress. Words can't even fully describe how horrible I feel about it. And I know she may say its not my fault but I feel like it is at least partially. I never wanted to cause them anymore stress or problems. I never wanted to make life harder for anyone but it feels like maybe thats all I do. I feel like I just make other people's lives just crappier. I don't try to do so intentionally. But I just happen to feel like thats the affect I have on people. And I've tried to do my part to help my ankle is weak as hell right now and standing is still hard for me but I tried to apply for jobs but I'm scared to work at certain jobs where manual labor is necessary or food places where the floor might be slippery I could be prone to fall and injure myself more. I'm not trying to make excuses for myself, I just feel so guilty and just so horrible about myself, like I'm causing so many people problems.

I feel so stupid, I sit here for hours crying because I feel like everyone in the world hates me, I'm useless, worthless, and a huge bitch that doesn't deserve anything, especially friends. I feel like I'm fucking up everyones day the moment I wake up and type, post, draw, let alone breath. I can't even be coherent anymore, let alone understand when friends are just messing with me in a light hearted way

It's a balance between that, feeling like it's my fault, but it's also a sour feeling of like they just wanna hurt me and use me, drag me around and make me the butt of everything. Like I'm so fucking worthless I'm wearing an invisible clown costume only they can see. Like I don't like anybody I'm around and I'm glad to be alone. I can't comprehend this and it's bothering me majorly 

I feel like I'm dragging my friends around on a rope whenever they suddenly start being silent towards me. I wanna talk to them more cause they make me really happy, but whenever they're online and won't even interact, I have a mental breakdown and cry like a whimp until they start talking to me, it feels like its out of pity, I'm still trying but it still feels wrong of me to bother them so much

Another friend was just having fun with my oc and their ocs on a game- a fucking simulator game, and even if it was probably meant to be light hearted and as a joke, everytime they said smth about my oc after they died or did something, I went over the top and started being passive aggressive, they weren't like this towards our other friends ocs and it threw me off, I cried cause it felt like I was being treated as the shitty 3rd wheel and they forced themselves to try and calm me down. They probably weren't even trying to be mean, I just took it too far and made it about myself- they stopped using my oc and I think it was deserved, why should I be apart of that stiff when I can't even take a joke 

I made a group of friends at school, bless their hearts, who've been trying and I feel like shit for how much they've tried to help me and comfort me, they're the best things I could have asked for and I'm super glad I met the girl that introduced me to them. Their amazing, but I've started treating them like shit. I fucked up the happy moment my doing something so minor- yet I took it to heart and felt like I shouldn't be there, so I started isolating myself and had what I'm use to dubbing it as an outburst. They didn't deserve me acting the way I did and being so cold with them, unfriending them from discord and leaving their server. I don't blame them for whatever they wanna do, I was screwed up and I messed up perfectly good relationships. I don't want them to feel they have to baby my ass when we go back to school

There are still a lot of things missing but it's a start

I know I posted venting, but mostly I'm asking, does anyone have any clue what might be wrong with me, what mental illnesses I might have or anyone dealt with similar
I'm 34 by the way


Fidgeting 
- I fidget alot, from tapping on things to bouncing my knee to biting my nails and chewing on my tongue and cheeks

Anxiety
- it never stops, the tiniest things set me off constantly
- I instantly spike on any phone notification, ringing, text sound, any buzzing, or even seeing the text symbol when I have my phone on mute
- I freak out at any sounds I hear outside my room, from people outside or thinking there is someone in the house

Memory
- I lose track of my thoughts really fast, it's becoming a problem with people I talk to because I need to stop and remember or ask what I was saying all the time
- I can't remember names of people if I go a few weeks  without talking to them
- I don't remember any of my family members or anythyfrom my childhood
- it's getting worse in the last couple years, I forget if I ate, took medication or even what day it is, often losing track of days at a time

Hearing
- I don't know if it's my ears, I was told I have dyspraxia, I often have to ask people to repeat what they said, like I hear them but it doesn't reach my brain or something
- there will often be times where if I'm listening to music or a videoand if someone talks to fast or a certain pitch, it doesn't register the words being said, only noise

Voices
- I don't hear people talking to me, other than a second thought voice, but I'm told that's normal
- I constantly hear breathing or sighing coming from the other side of doors or windows
- I also feel things touching me, like breathing on my nech or touching my leg or arm

ADHD or Autism
- I don't know if I have either, but everyone I know tells me I have one or both

Energy Motivation Determination Discipline
- I don't know, I just don't want to do anything, even when things get serious, I just don't do anything
- I was facing homelessness twice and I did nothing, I didn't even try, I just froze and let it happen

RSD
- Rejection Sensitive Disphoria
- I freeze and become unresponsive if I am around yelling, especially if it's towards me
- I don't react to my mess ups, if I drop food or water, I freeze and don't jump on it like you should and this leads to people yelling at me, saying I should know better, that I'm an adult, but all I do is stare and start to cry

Attention
- probably part of ADHD, I don't know, but I can't stick to one thing for more than an hour, even when I was working at Panera as a dishwasher, it took me way longer than it should to do the tasks they wanted me to do and while I lasted nearly two years, I just stopped going, i still don't know why
- every time I find something interesting, I try it for a short time, but I don't stay with it, I give up after a few days, it looked interesting, but I just can't keep any interest of find joy

Depression
- I have no joy in anything I do, I might laugh at a few things, but I quickly just stop caring
- I break down really easily and feel overwhelmed all the time
- even with my gf, who I care for more than anything, I still don't show or feel any joy, which is not fair to her

These things make me want to stop trying all together, just give up and disappear, stop being a burden to others

I have ADHD, major depressive disorder, and general anxiety disorder, but was only diagnosed recently at 19. Once I was with my aunt, I tried addressing my mental health issues with her, but she would always brush me off. ""Everyone gets anxious"", ""You are just sad today."" ""You just want attention, don't you?"" I know hearing all of these things did not help my mental health, but I couldn't do anything. I have been threated by my former abuser that if I step out of line, I will get thrown out. That I need to silent about whati see and what I feel, I wish the world has proven him right. When I tried speaking out to a therapist, she didn't help me. She would just say that I'm doing a good job, and I should tutor kids because I'm so smart. Every time I've tried reaching out and telling someone with how I feel, I'm either invalidated or 'brave'. They just all wanted me to go back to this wall person I created.

I fear (kinda anxious in my feelings in general) to reply their messages because I'm aware and think to myself if I put commitment to reply back, I'm just worried they eventually asking me for rendezvous or chores or to go cafes to ""just discuss"" and **half of my conversation with them I said NO (past experience, I did them and some I said NO)** to the point of even some of them only send memes, and I only have to react to it but worried they might leveraged the reacted meme into another loop of prolong conversation again that might ended up me doing something for them or for both of us. Which is sometimes annoying. And I'm tired to say no.
2. If I reply instantly I know I will gonna only little time to enjoy myself at the end of day in narrower time before going to bed, both physically and mentally (kinda draining to think after message replies about what they want and why they messaged me even I'm at my house.).
3. So right now for me, due to past occurrences If I have messages about work, friends, family, the second the notif rings the instant moment my stomach feels sick (nervous and kjnda anxious feeling) even tho it might something important or even not. So I avoid it until past due once again.

**Well, how some of you or people taking care of this issue if anyone has or in the moment facing somewhat similar issue like this ? what's the general rule and whatnot to deal with replying back and so on.**

2065,"Life full of heavy burdens and I don't know what to do.  Heavy burdens. Lately I've been overly tired, physically and I'm sure that's spilled into my mental space as well. I've had doubts, haven't felt like talking to people or doing much at times. That's kinda my own fault though for such fact.   


I don't know how to make friends or keep them. The one I had, well we speak less due to something that just happened. It's not to the point where we don't speak at all thankfully. It still hurts though. As much as it hurts I need to move forward.   


Which means, trying to find new friends. It's weird because I never had to restart in some sense. I guess I do have some people, I don't know I always had one person I relied on in life. Is that weird? I just, hardily open up. It's never been easy as I feel like if I do things could happen. Like really who knows what will happen if you do?   


I need to change this mentality somehow. I'm not certain how. How do I trust? How do I be? How do I stay motivated, do things in life.. It's been difficult.",Stressed
2066,"I feel like a burden.  For the past few weeks, I have been spiraling. I stopped taking care of myself and stopped caring about what was happening in my life. I didn't realize this was happening until my younger sister left for school in the morning and when I was positive she was far away I just broke down and cried. 

I am in college and for the first time, I started missing assignments this semester. I just feel so much apathy towards everything. I am just dissociating and nothing feels real. I have just been so exhausted too. I just keep sleeping and it's gotten to the point where my sister noticed. I feel horrible about how I have been doing academically this semester and how I have been hiding my mental health.

 I have tried to be more open about my depression but it's just honestly so difficult. I feel shame and embarrassment. I am supposed to be her big sister, taking care of her but I am not. I feel like a failure because I have fear of driving and that limits me so much. I honestly think if I wasn't here my family would have a more stress-free life. I hate to think my younger sister resents me for being mentally ill. I know my parents see me as ""that child"" the one that needs to be coddled and taken care of. I hate it. I hate how can't take care of myself. 

I do honestly try to be more independent. I made my own dinner for the first time last week and I am very proud that it came out decent even if it was a bit salty. I have been actively applying to remote jobs and I have been actively trying to keep a routine, however a part of me deep down just wants to give up, and lately, I have been listening to it. I don't have the motivation to live anymore. **I am not suicidal** but if I were to be in a situation where death is possible I am not going to do much to make sure I am alive.

I‚Äôm very worried about it all‚Ä¶ 

Last year she cheated on me with a new friend ( same gender as her). 

She has had many same gender relationships, that made me feel very betrayed and gave me a harder time trusting her ever again. 

She said she will never do it again, I just have a hard time trusting anyone after that. That is the only time I‚Äôm aware that she has done that. 

I understand that because of events of my childhood and teenage years, I find it very hard to trust in general. It causes a very immense amount of anxiety for me. I always feel like I‚Äôm not good enough, or someone better will come along. I feel like her own insecurities will drive her to someone else again. 


I try very hard to hold my feelings in, I feel like nobody cares and I‚Äôm ‚Äújust a man‚Äù so I should just shut it and move on. This has been causing a lot of pain and anxiety, just a horrible crushing fear that everything I enjoy between us will be gone.

2072,"I am literally a burden.  Guys, I am at my wit's end here. I need something to change. 

I am 28F and have had panic attacks since I was 7. I'm about to say something totally unacceptable in the mental health community, but please try to understand. When people around me say they have anxiety, I get so annoyed. By this, I mean ""oh, I get really anxious sometimes. I have anxiety."" I get that everyone experiences anxiety. I get that people struggle with anxiety disorders, and even ""normal"" people struggle at times. But it makes me so furious because most of these people have no fucking clue what a severe anxiety or panic disorder looks like and so they have no idea what it is really like. 

I feel crippled. I have had several instances in my life where I have hit a point so bad that I can't leave my house for months. I've laid on the couch for weeks just trying to get through each breath because I can't fathom anything else. I can't go out to eat without panicking. I can't travel more than an hour from my home, and even then it is very dependent on where I am traveling. I can't be in loud places or around new people without a support system. Sometimes I have panic attacks because the sun goes down, or because it storms outside, or because the lighting is off, or because I get nauseous or light headed. The list of shit I can't do feels endless. When I hit a really bad panic attack, it literally takes me a year to recouperate. I'm not kidding. It takes me a year to get back to ""normal,"" but each new normal is worse than the old one. I don't know when these will hit, so I live in constant fear of them. Will this be the time I can't eat or work or speak to my loved ones? I don't know. I can't afford to be out of work. My relationships can't afford me to be so fucking broken. 

Everyone in my life, which consists of my family, my partner, and one close friend, supports the shit out of me. They love me and they sacrifice for me. And I feel like the biggest burden because I honestly am. Their lives are limited by loving me. 

Tomorrow, my partner needs a ride to the airport. It's an hour away in heavy traffic. Not only can I not take her because I might have a panic attack from the traffic and be stranded, I also know I will sob and freak out because she will be out of my reach. For 2 days. It's only 2 fucking days. But I am so afraid of losing my mind, because I have in the past, that the thought of being alone is gut wrenchingly terrifying. What kind of life can my partner possibly have with me? She can't count on me. My presence in her life is emotionally and mentally draining. It's a ride to the airport. Anybody can do that. But I can't. 

I swear that I wasn't supposed to make it in this world but the people who love me have kept me afloat. It's fucking shameful. I don't want to be this person. I've been this way my entire life and it's not getting better. I have felt hopeless before, but lately I have been feeling a new kind of hopelessness. Almost a permanent kind. I always used to believe that I would figure it out someday, but now I'm just sitting here, facing the facts. And the facts are really bad. The facts are that this is my reality, my only conceivable future. 

Before anyone asks or mentions it, I've been in different kinds of therapy for years. I've been on several different meds. Currently on 3. I've meditated. I've done yoga. I'm literally just broken and I can't see a way out.

I'm not suicidal. But there is honestly nothing to look forward to, and no good can come to those I love by me being here.

I crave for attention and for someone to love me and be there with me but I push them away when they get too close because I don't want my problems to affect them. I was told by a friend that everyone I know likes me, and I just don't think I deserve it.

Everyday I wake up and go on my phone to see if anyone messaged me, but it's always everyone else having fun except me. When I try to have fun I always feel like I'm about to cry, and become a burden as people try to comfort me.

The suicidal thoughts have come back after about one year and a half. I was stable emotionally during all that time, but I fell in love with a close friend and found out it's unrequited and impossible. It sent me down an emotional rollercoaster, I feel happy, then sad, then angry all in between short periods of time. Sometimes I just feel incomplete, I lose all motivation and feel a void in my chest. It's incredibly overwhelming. Last week I walked 20 km for no reason whatsoever to see if I could shake off that feeling somehow

I have become paranoid again about any social relationships. I always feel like the other person is betraying me, or that I'm being left out if they begin hanging out with someone else. Like I'm always the third wheel.

I honestly am not sure if I , or what I am struggling with, even belongs here as I know it is minor compared to the fights many are pushing through with on here, but I‚Äôm not sure where else to go with this. For reference, I am currently going through some relationship struggles, and while I know there are subs that deal specifically with those matters, my real struggle is feeling alone right now and not having any where to turn to for help or just to express and unload the thoughts going through my head. While I know it may come off as toxic masculinity, the fact is that as a man I feel like I have little to no support group. I don‚Äôt have friends I can reach out to, as my entire life revolves around work or raising my family. In one I can‚Äôt unload on my coworkers and in the other is the very place I‚Äôm struggling at. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable enough to reach out to my immediate family, as some details are personal. Which leaves the only option left for help being counseling. Yet here I face a financial roadblock and while I know individuals have to make a living. I am not sure where or how I can pay and I can‚Äôt help but feel like I am just a dollar sign and not a person. This really hit hard today when I finally decided to reach out and began to submit my information to an online counseling site. I filled out all the general information and when it came to the give a description of what you‚Äôre looking for, I was finally able to put the thoughts racing through my head out into the open, all of which gave me a slight feeling of relief and a feeling that maybe I was finally heading in the right direction. This all came to a crashing halt when the very next page was one asking for payment information. It was such a cold and dehumanizing feeling. I hadn‚Äôt even been contacted by a human or given any sense of reassurance or compassion. I know people have to make a living and that there is both time and money invested by the counselors in order be able to provide their services, but I just can‚Äôt help but to feel turned off and demoralized.

So I(21M) have been diagnosed as depressed for 8 years and was diagnosed with severe social anxiety as of 3 years ago. Until the anxiety was diagnosed, I was not getting any sort of clinical help for my mental health. I had a fine support system, but there‚Äôs only so much help you can get from friends and family reassuring you that it‚Äôll all work out. For a few months before I got the diagnosis, I was regularly having panic attacks because of social situations. This led to me sheltering myself in my college dorm, missing classes, and having little to no social life. This, compounded with my untreated depression, meant that I could barely find the motivation to get out of bed some days.

2093,"I don't understand myself. It's confusing and it makes me feel like a burden to others  I  have 2 versions of myself.  These 2 switch without me wanting them to switch. 

One version is the one everyone who knows me know. It's adult me. 

The other version I have been around others who don't know. But then i need to play the other version wich is really hard and exhausting. But I've gotten good at it and it's only noticeable for the people who know the other version too. 

The other version I call mini. Mini is a lot younger then I physically am. Its not a specific age but if I'd had to put an age on it mini varies between 3 and 6.  Mini is more emotional. Wich is actually a good thing.  Mini switches between emotions fast. She can get upset when dropping a cookie she wanted to eat. But the cat coming to cuddle would instantly cheer her up. Mini has trouble saying long words and sentences. The letters R and L are always impossible to say. She can't write readable  getting hard questions or a lot of difficult information will get her overwhelmed.  Mini is afraid of a lot of things I'm not afraid of. Actually drinks chocolate milk wich i don't. 

It's confusing and i don't really understand it. I've been in age re groups but I don't really relate as I can't choose to switch it happens and I can't change it unless it happens by itself.  

I feel like a burden to my boyfriend since when I'm mini I need guidance. Someone who helps me a bit. Cuz when I'm mini I don't think about what i do and consequences. I would forget to eat cuz I'm to bussy playing.  Stay up too long. Wont do homework cuz its overwhelming or no fun. And he says he doesn't mind but I still feel like a burden.  

Mini has positive sides. I like being mini. But it's not always the right moment to switch. But when I'm mini I'm overall more happy. Cuz happy is mini's main emotion that and sleepy. I have less bad thoughts and feel less insecure. So those are positive.  But there are things that are necessary that I have trouble doing when mini. And that's anoying.",Stressed

Right now, I am sick. Last night, I vomitted 6x and is having extremely watery poo, and I got scolded because I wasn't taking care of myself. I was asking for my mom's help as the last time I vomitted was when I was 6 and it felt horrible on my throat. I keep telling her ""mom, what do I do? Do I drink water?"" and she would reply ""It's because of that goddamn phone, now look at yourself. On the verge of dying, why wont you listen to me that gadgets kill people!"" she scolded me and all but said nothing to help me or command me on what I should do. She cooked me rice porridge because it's the only thing that she could cook at the moment (it happened 3:40 AM) and I was just worried that I'd actually die because she told me I'm on the verge of dying and my throat feels horrible. While I was eating, she's just on her phone using TikTok.

It's currently 5PM and she still hasn't took me to the hospital. The whole day, she's just talking about how careless I was for not looking after myself and that me being sick is another bullet in her workload.

I feel horrible, I feel like a burden. I'm stuck from my past thoughts, wishing that I was aborted, in that way I wouldn't be a burden for her.

 I have had a bad experience in the past where one of my so - called friend basically told me to never talk about my depression ever again or my friends will leave me. Like what, do I have to show a fake ""me"" just to have a few social interactions?

Why when you open up to people, they abandon you even when they say ""I'll be there for you"", ""You can talk about it with me if you want"". Like why everytime I meet a new person, they encourage me to open up to them because they don't want to see me suffer alone but after a while, they just leave.

Am I that unimportant to others? 

I've been thinking about ending my life but I haven't tried yet because I thought I had people that supported me . But now, no one is here for me. I have to either not talk about it at all and wear a fake mask to hide my true self or I risk getting abandoned.

I was the one who encouraged them to apply for the role as we are friends and had worked together prior so felt guilty all this was going on.

Anyway, it turns out the employer was very reluctant to grant any leave for them to try and figure out their mental health. Just like if someone was physically sick or injured would be given time off, because it was a mental health issue it was largely dismissed as something they will get over.

There was no support or empathy and it turned into a troubling attitude from the company. 

It made.me think though, alot of companies come out and say they support mental health or claim to be raising awareness but when it comes to the crunch, it's a burden on their resources and still has a stigma around it.

2110,"i feel like a burden  tw // mentions of s*xual abuse/r*pe 

i (f) been in a long relationship w my bf, and i‚Äôve dealt with mental health issues for a long time before i met him. 

i‚Äôve been dealing w being raped by a close friend in high school and sexually abused when i was a child, and a severe anxiety disorder that formed as a result from trauma from my childhood and from bullying. i‚Äôve had severe droughts of depression where i had suicidal ideation but never carried out - mainly just wanted to disappear from existence, while not burdening or hurting others around me. 

my bf has never dealt with mental health issues before he met me, and even tho we‚Äôve been together for 4+ years, the more we get comfortable the more i feel like.. i‚Äôm a burden and he doesn‚Äôt want to understand. i‚Äôm not trying to blame him for anything - i know how difficult it can be to deal w a SO that has severe mental health issues. i also know that along with becoming more comfortable with each other, the more i‚Äôve lashed out or let my mental health issues affect the way that i speak to him/act towards him. but now, i just also feel that he doesn‚Äôt really care to understand, and if we sit down and talk about things it always starts off in a huge fight or argument and then eventually ends with apologizing and resolutions on how we can ‚Äúbe better.‚Äù 

i just don‚Äôt think we have been working to be better though. i haven‚Äôt really seen him do individual research on what anxiety looks like in different people/situations, i haven‚Äôt really seen him make an effort to ask me more about why i may feel the way i feel about things. i just don‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs interested in all of that anymore. i‚Äôve gotten to the point where i‚Äôm annoyed with myself and how much i use my anxiety as an excuse for how i‚Äôm feeling or why i do certain things in the way that i do them - but at the end of the day it really is the only true explanation behind my words/thoughts/actions that i can give. 

i just feel like at this point i am a burden on everyone. i don‚Äôt even want to open my mouth anymore because if i do i know that i may say or do something in a certain way that will result in an argument, and i‚Äôll have to explain that it was because of my anxiety again. 

i feel like i am trying my best to do better and be better,  but it‚Äôs so incredibly difficult to be the first one to do that. my bf does not deal with mental health issues, but i do - so when we have a conversation about something, i can be more sensitive about things that he is. so is it wrong if me to want him to be more patient with me and try to help me be better by him being better? is it wrong of me to feel like... if he was just slightly more patient with me in the beginning and showed me that he actively wants to learn more about me and my emotions, that i will also start to feel more understood and heard by him... therefore making me less prone to acting out a certain way? is it wrong of me to feel like i want him to initiate the change in being better? because i feel like if i try to initiate that and he doesn‚Äôt show that he is actively trying to be better while i AM trying to show that i am trying to be better... i will not be able to make any change? 

i don‚Äôt know if any of this makes sense but am i selfish for thinking this way? i feel like such a burden even thinking like this and asking for that  but i feel like he is more oblivious to things when it comes to anxiety and emotions and i feel so discouraged to share anything or talk about anything deeper w him even though we‚Äôve been together for 4+ years. 

sorry for the word dump, i‚Äôve got so much on my mind and i don‚Äôt rly know how to eloquently word it. he‚Äôs not a shitty partner at all - he just lacks in the emotional intelligence department a whole lot bc he‚Äôs never personally experienced it before being with me.",Stressed
2111,"Burdened by Expectation while doing nothing to achieve anything  Hi, I have an issue with my mental health. Lately, I was diagnosed moderate depression. My story starts from the beginning of my university. During my school period (since elementary school until high school) I was very confident with my works. I always get what I consider the best from my efforts.   
However, everything changed since I go to one of the best university in my country. I met a lot of great people from other region/province. I started to live alone and away from home in a rented apartment. 

In the first year of my university, everything went well (I got 3.97 GPA on the first year) although I often feel unconfident with my social life. But it changed during the start of the second year. I occasionally start slacking off (because I feel freedom for being alone, I thought I could do anything). I started to procrastinate my home works, my responsibility in one of the student organization while playing dota 2 almost everyday. The pressure build up and I got one big problem. One of my best friend in my organization started to notice my decreasing performance. He was mad at me because I do my job poorly. I was shocked and feel guilt for what I have done. It really hit me mentally.

With my procrastination habit started to stick with my life and with high expectation (Due to my great achievement from the past), I started to feel pressurized with everything I do. Whenever I do my job, I started to ask ""Am I good enough to be the best?"". This way of thinking keep spiraling in my head until I feel really overwhelmed at some point, I started to feel difficult on just starting a simple task. The psychiatrist I visited told me that I am burdened by expectation. I also develop porn addiction in my final year. The guilt for what I have done really burdened me. 

I recently graduated from my university with excellent GPA but it cost me mentally. My friends praised my achievement but I feel useless and think ""I didn't deserve this"" every time. My parents want me to continue studying for master degree although at this point I feel like I want to rest and make up my mind. Currently, I am already enrolled in a university abroad. The professor give me a job but until now, I could not start doing my job because of the expectation burden I have. Its been almost a month but I haven't achieve anything.

2125,"Feeling like a burden to everyone (and being upset with others/others being upset with me).  So I was feeling better for some time but recently thoughts have came back up again about feeling like a burden to everyone and being upset with many others. It's a long story that I won't fully get into here but basically I've felt that I've upset, annoyed, and/or bothered a lot of people over the years (especially in recent years) and often times without meaning to at all. Frustrated people in my family, seemed like annoyed a ton of people in high school, and confused dorm-mates in college. And there are still some people that I feel upset with too, some currently in my life, some from the past (that I still think about).

I often have some strange habits that I thing can bother people. I get paranoid and anxious a lot, sometimes space out, sometimes think out loud/talk to my myself, have some weird OCD like habits, and I also can get frustrated easily. All those small things can just add up and I feel like I always bother someone no matter what. Trying to be friendly but instead people think I'm being wired, people thinking I'm creepy when I'm spacing out or whispering to myself (which I can understand why they might think that, but that's not my intention at all). Family members getting frustrated with the habits I have (washing my hands more than I need to, opening and closing doors multiple times, unintentionally keep them when pacing around at night, going to the bathroom more often than I really need to sometimes, etc. All a bunch of small things that shouldn't matter but when they build up on each other, it can feel like a lot. And there's this constant feeling I'm always being judged for everything I do and sometimes people have questioned it. Some people seem to act like I'm messed up or a creep, or something like that from the vibe I've gotten from them.


Just last night the thoughts randomly came back to my head again (as they occasionally passively do). That added on top of the fact that I'm busy with having to pack and move houses with my family, and I still have a lot more to do (I'll admit I got a bit lazy and procrastinated on it), combined with other stressors and things keeping me busy, and it's all piling up on me again. It's all mostly a bunch of small that shouldn't matter too much in the long run, but when they all build up on each other, it can start to feel like a lot.

And I feel like no matter what, even when things get better for awhile, and I am happier and having fun, the thoughts I mentioned above earlier will always keep coming back to me at some point, when I don't want it or expect it to but I end up feeding into thoughts anyways. As if it's almost just a habit or occasional pass time that I've gotten used to. I feel like at this point I'm just going to have life with those thoughts. Of being upset with other and feeling like a burden to most people. And I feel like I could also trust people less because of it. Yes I could change the habits that I have but that's a lot easier said than done. Sometimes I feel like I can't help it or I need to to do things like think out loud and process things. I just hope this doesn't keep upsetting me more and that I don't turn into the monster (that many others seem to think I already am )because of it. 

Regardless, I'll just try to move on and keep going. Maybe start fresh with the new house I'm moving to. But it won't be easy per say, as the thoughts will probably keep coming back as long as I'm around. Or at least that's how I feel about it right now. Just not exactly sure what to do but I guess I'll just try to keep going.

You're annoying. Nobody likes you, or likes hearing from you. Just be quiet and die quietly"" came roaring back. Long time no see >\_>

When I did CBT, the lady I was talking to mentioned using a One Minute Rule, time to suit the individual. If you need to, think about the situation. Think ""Is there a reason Person X would feel this way about me? Is there any evidence?"" etc. But once that mental timer is up, push it out of mind.

But its not working. Like. The sum of my reply was the equivalent of ""Thank you! This helps & means a lot. Love you, talk soon"" (we say love a lot) but idk. Its that inescapable weight round your neck, something weighing you down.

2132,"I feel like a passive-aggressive burden  For 18 years, I‚Äôve had a well-respected reputation with my family, friends and peers. I would always do as I‚Äôm told, treat others with respect, and enjoy my time in and out of school. I‚Äôve made many friends that liked different things (Video games, sports, lifting, manga, music, movies, tv shows, writing, cooking, driving, socializing, online sports leagues, etc). Additionally, my parents would always say I‚Äòm good at talking to adults (and that i‚Äôm too mature for kids my age). 

In March, when schools closed and we were in quarantine, I had much time to re-evaluate myself and push to become a stronger, better person. 

As stupid as this sounds, I realized how rude and bad of a person I was to others. Every friend I‚Äôve made, whether they were in my life for 1 week or my whole life, I feel like I made them worse. I feel like i lost focus of others and only looked at what benefitted myself, even if the other person would get their way. For a while, I believed others were in the wrong (when an altercation happened, minor or major). A lot of it would stem from my ‚Äúinability‚Äù to say no. I guess it becomes clear that I was denying my own morality and living a unaware life. 

When i met up with the same friends after quarantine, everything to me was different. I realized how off everything felt and what life I was making for myself. I feel like I was always the butt of the joke, and I made it that way because of my lack of awareness. Even though I thought I was doing the right thing, it became clear that I was the outcast. Now it feels like it‚Äôs better off that I avoid others. 

After the last few days / weeks of meeting with family, I‚Äôve realized how imperfect and awkward I truly am. I don‚Äôt mean to put the blame on others, considering it‚Äôs all my own thoughts. Psychologically, I feel tortured and it‚Äôs all happening because I deserve it.

2134,"Grew up feeling like asking for things was a burden, followed into adulthood.  I've come to the realization today that spending money on myself has caused me to feel like a burden to my husband, as it did to my parents when I was a child.
My parents divorced when I was 8 years old, and between their battles of who has kids and when, I remember mostly them always arguing about money, specifically important money like who would pay my medical bill for my ER visit, or pay my school lunch bill. It got to the point that I felt it was my fault. I stopped asking for things that I needed and just tried to handle myself, even as a young teenager. I would wear pajama pants under my jeans in the winter because I was too afraid to ask for new snow pants (grew up in Wisconsin where it can get to -50¬∞ wind chill), I would slip the lunch money lady $2 every day so I could eat because I had a negative balance in my account (I eventually paid it off in full with my own money so I could graduate). I never felt safe to bring up these expenses to my parents because it would just lead to a fight and make me feel even worse. Their fights basically led to no one taking care of the expenses and leaving the issue on me.
I'm now in a marriage where I'm a SAHM and my husband supports the family. Money can be tight sometimes, so barely ever ask for anything for myself. He sometimes guilts me too when I ask to buy things (get hair done, maternity clothes, etc) mostly things HE finds unnecessary but gives my self-care and comfort.
How do I get out of this funk? How do I accept that I'm worth more than wearing the same shirt 3 days in a row because it's the only thing that fits me, or wearing the same eye glasses from 2013 because eye exams and glasses are a big expense?

Tomorrow I will turn 22. For the past eight years, I've been struggling with low self esteem, and what I recently got diagnostized as mild depression. I was bullied in school because I was the quiet smart guy type, then became the weird guy nobody talks to. Thinking back, I had no character, I was simply a smart child. I had a friend that I met on an online game. I considered him my best friend. I also had a ""girlfriend"" (we were 12 so nothing extraordinary happened). One day I introduced them to each other as they were two important persons in my life. After maybe a week, she left me for him. I felt anger, sadness, I felt that life wasn't fair, that I should trust nobody because anybody can betray me. Since then I just started to blame myself for letting this happen. I spent the rest of middle school alone, because those I though were my friends were actually her friends.

&#x200B;

When I was in high school, I met wonderful people that became my friends. Some of them are now my best friends. We would play for hours, laugh, talk about anything. They made me forget about my sadness, about my anger, about everything. But when I was alone I still felt empty.

&#x200B;

After I had my diploma, I started to study IT. I kinda linked IT, but I mostly did it to follow my friends. I still felt empty, but knowing I would see them everyday was enough to make me happy. But years passed, and most of them are now at the other side of the contry, in great universities. I'm still studying in my hometown because I'm too lazy or too scared to move that far from home.

&#x200B;

So for years, when I woke up in the morning, my first though was ""I hope I get hit by a car today, so that I finally stop existing.."". Too depressed to enjoy life, but at the same time too cowordly to end it myself.

&#x200B;

For the last two years, I've tried to meet new people. i've joined a pen and paper role playing game club at my universities, and have met great people I still play with regularly. One of them, let's call him Bob, invited me to dm at a party at his girlfriend's house earlier this year. I was not sure what would happen, but I guess I just went with it to see. It was great. I had so much fun. It was not the blasting-music-drinking-all-night-long kind of party, it was more of a chill party, where we play, speak, laugh and have a good time together. I loved it.

&#x200B;

Some days after, Bob's girlfriend (let's call her Jess) messaged me on discord to talk about how I was cool and she wanted to invite me for the next time. I was thrilled. Having someone tell me that my presence was liked. That made me so happy...

&#x200B;

Over the few months following this, she invited me to all sorts of events, parties, and it was frankly the best months of my life. I felt like I had friends, but real friends, not online friends. We were talking a lot, and I really mean a lot. She was cute, intelligent, our conversations always were meaninful. But, at one point it happened, and I fell in love with jess. I was devastated because I felt like I was betraying Bob by having these feelings. I hated myself, but after some days trying to hide these, I had to tell her, I was getting exhausted. I knew she wouldn't be mad. She conforted me, telling me it was not my fault, it happens. She was actually happy I told her and that I didn't just held them for me.

&#x200B;

So for months I stayed in love with her, and things were smooth. We talked even more, I would tell her how much she meant to me, and she would confort me when I felt down. She helped me open to some of my friends about my emotions, because we never talked about that between ourselves. She made me feel hope about my life. At one point she even kissed me, to try, hoping she would dislike it, because she was catching feelings for me. But she told me she loved Bob and would not leave him. And that even if she left him, nothing would happen between us two. I was really sad, but went along, because I loved her, I loved spending time with her.

&#x200B;

Last month, she invited me to spend some days with her and Bob when they were camping. I was so happy. It was actually the best holidays I've ever had. that is until... I made a huge mistake... I can't exactly tell what happened, but it was big enough so that she really hesitated to break of all ties. I was devastated. She was hurt. After a week, we talked about it. She told me she forgave me, but at the same time could never forget what I did. Now, she is unconfortable being with just me. And I can understand that. And I hate myself for that.

&#x200B;

So here I am. I feel like I have lost everything. I don't know what to do. I still love her, she means so much to me, but at the same time I know nothing will ever be the same with her. But still, for my birthday party (that I did last week to have as much friends home as I could), she spoke to all of them so that they could group and buy me a ps4. I had mixed feelings... I was so happy because I wanted one and they all participated.. But at the same time I feel like I didn't deserve it. I am a burden. The only thing I do is hurt people. Is hurt my friends. I hate myself for everything I have done to her, because I've hurt her profondly, yet she still went on her way to make me happy. I feel like the biggest douchebag on earth. I shouldn't be alive, I shouldn't have these people as friends. I know they like me and they want to see me happy. But I can't. I feel like I made them waste their money and time. For the past week, I have been alternating between sadness, indifference, anger against myself, several time an hour. I feel like I will explode if I continue like that...

&#x200B;

Several months ago, I went to see my doctor to talk about my depression and got diagnostized with mild depression. He gave me anti-depressants, and a paper to give to a psychologist I should see. But I never took them. And I never went there. I feel like if I go there, I will waste his time, and take someone else place, someone that could really need it, more than me. I'm not worthy enough...

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do now. I don't know if I should just let time flows, see how things goes. I still love her, but I know I can't continue like that, because it will lead nowhere. I hate myself for crying like that over the internet...",Stressed

Relevant information:
I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, Bipolar 1, & CPTSD.
Partner and I have been together for about 10 years. We got together after my last involuntary commitment, and I was in intensive treatment for the first few years of our relationship. 
I am currently unmedicated, and not in therapy. Cost is the mitigating factor there.
I'm in the US, in the midwest.


My mental health has deteriorated over the last year, but the last few months have been really bad.
I've transitioned from 'passively' suicidal to actively making plans.
I've managed to not cut myself, but barely.
I can barely function right now.
I'm barely eating, what I am is out of a bag or box.
I'm barely keeping it together at work. I've made some mistakes I definitely shouldn't have.
I'm sleeping whenever I'm not at work, or mindlessly scrolling on my phone because I can't handle anything right now.


Partner is ""fed up with my negative attitude"" and ""tired of never seeing happiness in me anymore"". 

When I try to tell Partner how poorly I'm doing I'm making it their problem or making it harder for them.

They don't believe I'm trying hard enough and I don't know what else to do.


I'm lost and floundering.  I don't know how to move towards making myself better, and I don't know how to not burden Partner.

2138,"My anxiety makes me feel like a constant burden on myself and others  I‚Äôm trying very hard to recognize that not everything is meant to hurt me, but sometimes I only realize after the moment has passed. I find that I can be very defensive over nothing and very discouraged over stuff that was not intended to wound me. 

This has caused arguments with friends, my boyfriend, and pretty much everyone in my life. It‚Äôs usually a self fulfilling prophecy. I feel like I‚Äôm a burden, someone says something or acts in a way that I perceive as confirmation of this, I make a deal out of it, and the person gets annoyed at me. And then I just feel like a bigger burden when it‚Äôs all said and done. 

It‚Äôs hard to feel guarded like that and it‚Äôs probably hard on the people I care about. I‚Äôm trying to get better with it, but sometimes I fall into the old habit. 

Recently, I completely broke down to my therapist about this feeling. It is overwhelming and consuming, and I hate having to live with it. The overthinking consumes my life sometimes. 

I guess I just want to know that it can better. I want to know that these feelings do go away and get better. I want to know that I can participate in life, with my loved ones, without feeling guarded. I want to be able to better decipher when someone is joking with me, so I never get to the point of starting a pointless argument. 

This is a genuine point of self-hatred and it drives me crazy. The self actualization of it drives me crazy. I perceive myself as burdensome and project this image onto others that lead to actual fights. Sometimes I feel like I want to hide from the world completely.

I feel like I get pulled into other's relationships so I don't feel lonely. I just, think my friends would be much happier without me  


I'm realizing how much if a hypocrite I am. I made these big deals to stop my friends from doing this to themselves. God I'm a fucking failure.

At this point I don't care who sees this. It hurts so much. I just want to feel loved by myself and someone else other than my family for once. My school made it against policy (class 2 sexual violation, even with consent) to hug people, so that emotional outlet is well, gone. I look like wet concrete, I sound like a voicecrack trumpet, I'm overall unattractive. And I have NO skill. This just hurts. I want to cry right now, but it feels like something is physically stopping me. I haven't had suicidal thoughts in forever, I'm good in that spot.

2146,"I Feel Like Such a Burden (long)  Let me start by saying that l've recently been diagnosed with chronic major depression/anxiety and chronic major PTSD, through my problems started when I was around 7 years old.

I became a ward of the state when I was 12 years old under the care of my maternal grandparents. I had court mandated therapy, but they never diagnosed me with anything so my grandma just thought I was going to be okay after a little opening up. She was wrong.

I never did well in school, it made me anxious. I've had so many bad experiences relating to school and other structured environments like it that I seem to always find a way to set myself up for failure just to get away from it. After college I jumped from job to job, abandoning ship when everything became to much. I was just hoping that the next place would be different and I would be happy.

Now I'm engaged, I have a great job and my wedding is literally 250 days away. Everything should be good right? Nothing has gotten better, my psychiatrist ordered a month leave from work to get used to meds and relax and it was working- I thought I was finally going to be okay. But now I'm back at work and I'm already right back where I was before my break.

My psychiatrist thinks quitting work would be best and my fiance says he can make it work- but I see the look on his face when we talk about him being the sole income. He's so worried. He says he cares more about me being okay and being happy, but I feel so guilty. I feel like I'm using him and I feel like others are going to think that too.

We're training our puppy to be my service animal and she does help- I just cant take her to work yet. And applying for disability is possible, but they almost always deny on the first try and take 6 months to do so. They also require a 6 month leave of no working.. which means no income. So that's going to be at least a year of one income with a wedding and two cars we have to pay for. 

My fiance already budgeted it out, he can do it. But I feel so useless and so guilty that I just wish he had met someone more stable than me. I wish I didn't exist. I don't know what to do.",Stressed

The docs there sent me through four hours of testing and tried to tell her I ordered the tests. Not true in the least. Basically I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Apparently they, nor the docs office could comprehened that I'm told to go to Emergency when it is that bad because I can interfere with the heart beat. Me I didn't think it was that bad.

2151,"Feeling like a broken burden on people in my life  Hey :)

So I've been through a ton of shit throughout my life. I'm a 21 year old woman and I've been in therapy since I was 16. Sexually/physically abused by a male family member from ages 7-12, then again at 19 by a male best friend in my sleep. During my childhood abuse, child protective services had to get involved for parental neglect and my parents told me to ""not say anything bad about ""x-person"" because we don't want to get them in trouble"". Also, whenever the childhood abuse would happen, I would yell out for help and my parents would punish me for ""making too much noise"". Just like a person with PTSD, depression, and anxiety usually develops unproductive coping mechanisms, I started using drugs, self harm, and relied on an eating disorder to get me through. I am FINALLY in recovery for all of this- completed 3 months of rehab, stayed in sober living, have three therapists (including a family one), a psychiatrist, and a nutritionist. I am proud to say I am just over 6 months sober!! Got my own apartment and am finally working on loving myself. Even though I am reallllly working hard on myself and I acknowledge the immense growth that's taken place over a short period of time, I still feel eternally broken. I feel so damaged, I have horrible trust issues and insecurity and that's the only thing that really stirs arguments between my partner (22m) and I. He has given me absolutely zero reason to not trust him-he showers me with so much love, attention, patience, and understanding. The dude even bought a book about being in a relationship with someone /supporting a partner who has ptsd from childhood incest sex abuse. Regardless of all this, I can't shake the feeling that he'll eventually grow tired of dealing with all of my mental health issues. I'm so fucking sensitive, the smallest things can make me spiral into a crying fit. Even if my bf were to make a joke about a cute girl, i'll feel an intense fear of abandonment. I always tell him to not take what I have to say personally, and that I'm usually projecting my lack of self worth onto his feelings towards me. I just don't understand how he still wants to be a part of my life...how he still loves me, feels attracted to me, wants to continue being my best friend, etc.. I feel so undeserving of him and it feels too fucking good to be true. This is the first person in my life to show me genuine love, first person who I even genuinely love... and it's goddamn TERRIFYING! I can't stand how my anxiety can't accept what he tells me. I tell him every now and then that he deserves so much more, somebody who is easier, because I feel like I'm too much for anybody to love. I feel like he puts up with me, like I'm almost a chore. I just want to tell myself to shut the fuck up and be in the present. I can rationalize it all, I'm also pretty emotionally aware (something I find very appealing about myself actually), but when it comes to trusting this man I care for so much and actually listen when he tells me I'm his soulmate, I'm a fucking moron lol. God knows how long I'll struggle with this lack of trust and debilitating fear of being hurt...So yeah..that's pretty much how I'm feeling right now. 

I'd really appreciate it if other people just told me if they relate, how y'all feel or what y'all would do..accepting any piece of reassurance or advice :) 

Thank u xx",Stressed
2152,"i feel useless and I am a burden  I just noticed how dull my life actually is. 

I wake up around 6-6:30am each day.  I get up, wander around my room, find my clothes. I go downstairs, get my lunch in my bag and tell dad I‚Äôm ready to go. He turns the car on, I toss my stuff in the backseat and we go. I get to school around 7am. I either go to regulation drill, color guard, or talk with my boyfriend if he‚Äôs not at crack drill. 

I go to my classes. First hour economics honors, it‚Äôs boring I don‚Äôt talk to anyone because I get ignored and spoken over. I do my work and try to get through the class. I understand it but the tests mess me up. 
Second hour. Rotc, I sit and do my work as I‚Äôm told. I do the papers, then turn them in. On Wednesday‚Äôs our whole brigade (during that hour) gathers in the gym, we get in formation, do announcements and then disperse to wait for the bell to ring. 

Third hour, band. My favorite class. My friends are all here. Except my boyfriend. I play trumpet. I do my part as we practice for the field show tomorrow night. I look forward to it. Band is the one thing I think is keeping me from just giving up school activities all because of last years band director. 
Fourth hour. Chemistry. I try my best to understand. I talk to nobody except the teacher and maybe another classmate or two during labs. It‚Äôs mainly note taking on isotopes, and whatnot. It‚Äôs dull. I hate it. I do badly on tests anyways. 

Fifth hour is religion. I can sit there and do absolutely nothing the entire time. I can sleep, read a book or even browse the Internet if I want to. The teacher doesn‚Äôt notice and if I‚Äôm called on I just need to know the question and I will answer it. I know too much about religion and I feel as if this is all just being crammed down my throat just like middle school. 
Six hour. Algebra 2/trig. Teacher is chill. He has a gecko. She‚Äôs a good gecko but dislikes people and hasn‚Äôt been feeling well lately. I do my work most of the time and try my hardest to pay attention. It‚Äôs hard, I know what‚Äôs going on but I can‚Äôt focus and I feel sleepy. I do badly at tests in this class too. 

Seventh hour is AP English. We read pages in our books, write annotations and in class essays each week. It‚Äôs exhausting and I hate it. 

Day ends. I either go to d&d club, wait till later that night for pep band/color guard, do homework or go home. I get home, do whatever homework I haven‚Äôt done and then get ready for tomorrow. I might watch tv if my parents aren‚Äôt hogging it. I rarely watch tv or want to play video games anymore. Most of the time I get tired by 9:30, go to sleep and then do it all over again. 

I have no close friends in school or in my classes. My best friend transferred schools and I don‚Äôt talk to her hardly ever. My middle school friends don‚Äôt invite me to anything, they don‚Äôt really talk to me even when I start talking. I don‚Äôt feel as if I can relate to anybody anymore. I talk to myself, always tap my foot to music that isn‚Äôt playing, whistle too much, click my tongue till people give me looks, I hide in my books, I am on my phone or staring off into space. I talk about my feelings too much towards my boyfriend and he doesn‚Äôt know how to fix me so he sets me down and walks away until I sort things out and feel better. It doesn‚Äôt sound like he‚Äôs doing the best thing but he is. I love him yet I feel like a burden to everyone. 

I can‚Äôt focus. Can‚Äôt get good grades. Everything is at a C. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Getting help doesn‚Äôt help. I don‚Äôt want to fail anything or I will absolutely hate myself, my parents will scream at me endlessly and my boyfriend will too. I stress myself too much and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I get depressed moods for no reason. There is no trigger to it. I feel anxious in large overcrowded, bright and noisy rooms. I can‚Äôt stand it to the point of needing to cover my ears. I sit and listen more than I include myself. There is something wrong with me. My mother refuses to see it. But I do. Something is up and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. I want the emotions to stop. I want to stop feeling feelings. I hate them.",Stressed
2153,"Why does upholding social contacts feel like such a burden too me?  I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. I wasn‚Äôt ever a ‚Äòsocial butterfly‚Äô, don‚Äôt feel like I ever had friends or people who liked me besides members of my family. And that‚Äôs literally my only goal in life. To have a friend, to be happy.

But recently I noticed this pattern if one wanted to call it that. I‚Äôm really bad at upholding social relationships. Even if it‚Äôs just calling another person or texting them because I want to ask them how they are, I won‚Äôt do it. I won‚Äôt take the first step, so in most cases I just do nothing. Even if they are family members. It‚Äôs so, so hard to actually text back or call them. 

Example: My cousin has moved to the region I live in and has expressed interest in meeting up once in a while. He‚Äôs great and I like him a lot and want to meet him but... he‚Äôs not like me, he‚Äôs busy, he has friends, a girlfriend and we don‚Äôt have any particular ‚Äòbond‚Äô, we only see each other a few times a year, so we aren‚Äôt exactly close.

Maybe I should reach out to him but can‚Äôt bring myself to even ask him over text. Because I feel like a nuisance. And I don‚Äôt know how to talk to people. I‚Äôm just awkward and always second guessing everything I think or say. It doesn‚Äôt feel right. And it‚Äôs exhausting and draining.

I know I‚Äôm pushing people away with this and I know I am a terrible person but everything social is always so overwhelming to me. Like all other people are moving at twice my speed and I cannot possibly keep up. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a boring person. I don‚Äôt have cool hobbies, I can‚Äôt tell jokes, I hurt people‚Äôs feelings easily without even knowing I did, I‚Äôm not particularly smart either and know nothing about how the world works. 
And I won‚Äôt take action until someone pushes me. 

I don‚Äôt know why staying in contact with people is so hard for me. I don‚Äôt mean to ghost anyone. I care about other people and their feelings. Or at least I choose to think so. I would like to not be that person. I would like to be able to talk to people how others do. It seems so easy for them, while I seem to avoid having to interact with other people for as long as people. 

But maybe it‚Äôs better that way. All people I know have their own social circle. They would be fine even I didn‚Äôt exist. Maybe they would be even better off. Without me making things awkward and not texting back.

2154,"""You are not a Burden, You are Wonderful""  As someone who struggles with anxiety and depression, my brain is constantly at war with itself. Part of me feels so low that I feel like I can't get out of bed some days, but then my anxiety is screaming at me to get up -- what will they think if you laid in bed all day? there's so much to be done, and you're letting it pile up; you're a slob, you don't want other people to know you're a slob do you? The battle with my own thoughts literally never stops.

And this is just one example of how it affects me in life; every day is a dramatic play of my own internal monologue arguing with itself. It carries over into my social life, into my self esteem, cuts into my passion for my hobbies, self assurance and desire to put myself out there, & even effects my relationships. 
I go absent because I am working through my own demons and being social is exhausting. I often feel like I've repeated myself in what I'm going through behind the scenes & it never really gets easier to cope. But I'm taking it a day at a time, and I'm starting to realize that's okay -- even if I feel like a burden on those in my life because one day I'm on top of the world and another I'm standing in a shower where the water has run cold and just let the tears roll. No 2 days are the same, and my healing journey has been a roller coaster.
I have made SO much progress, and for that I am grateful. Living with mental illness is not easy, but I'm thankful to have such a strong support system, to be getting therapy, and to be making steps towards a better me tomorrow. And if you're reading this and have been there for me ever, know I am eternally grateful for you and everything you have done for me, no matter how small.

Sadly, not everyone is so lucky -- there are many others like me as depression & anxiety are 2 of the most common mental health disorders out there, yet we shy away from talking about it and so many stigmas are stuck to these people just looking to calm the storm in their own minds. 
For some, the burden of carrying their own sorrow becomes too much and they crumble under the weight and act out. Some leave this world because they feel that they can't share the burden with those they love, after all, they don't want to be a burden on others. They try to carry it all alone or simply don't have the support system they need to heal. 

That's why I urge you everyday, but especially today on Mental Health Day, to remember your friends slogging through the mud on their uphill climb from the trenches of depression, the ones holding their stomach in public or cancelling plans because their anxiety makes them so sick they feel like they could puke and a migraine throbs behind their eyes sockets and across their forehead, as they struggle to pull themselves out of bed in the morning, or simply look in a mirror: just love them. Remind them that they are important to you, listen to them - even if you don't have the words to comfort them. 

Remind them that it's okay to not be okay and that ""You are NOT a burden.""

If you struggle with mental illness, please don't give up. Talk to someone you love, who you trust. Seek out help. For the amount of people there are who will shame you for your illness, there are people 10 fold who want to help you.

YOU are NOT a burden.
You are WONDERFUL.

So I just graduated from high school through the IB program. I've decided to take a gap year. However, although my parents do not really oppose this decision, I can't help but feeling completely useless and a burden to my parents. Yes, I am trying my best to fund my gap year so i am making some money through teaching math and music, but I feel really shameful and guilty knowing that many of my peers are going directly into university whereas for me, I'd be staying home with my parents in September. The thought of adulting really terrifies me and I have always been quite independent therefore I feel like I am obligated to leave home ASAP. Perhaps another factor is that I am not really on good terms with my parents in terms of doing chores and sharing household responsibilities. I know I absolutely should do chores and understand their frustration with me not doing so, but I find that I tend to really avoid chores. When I do not do chores, they tend to passively blame me for it and recently have been threatening to require me to pay rent if I don't. Which does seem like a reasonable request but just made me feel very unwanted and like a burden to them.  They were also implying that I won't be successful in my future careers if I don't do chores, and talking about how other kids started doing chores at a very young age (I did too but I didn't do chores consistently). Despite surviving and graduating from IB, an internationally recognized rigorous academic program, I still feels like a failure and am slightly depressed.

2160,"Mind Diary #1 - Burden of Sorrow (What Now?)  Today is the day I truly sit down and write it all out. I'm going to try my absolute hardest, but it has to be done. I need help, and even writing it out is going to help, in one way or another.

Listening to Fallujah after a phone call with my best friend really opened my eyes to everything around me, as much as every other friend I truly care about has in the past. 
I recently lost the relationship with my girlfriend. Whilst our dating time was short (September-Jan), it was intense and it was the best, actual relationship out of the two that I have had. She was in pain and I did the best I could. Throughout the week leading up, I had a horrible feeling in my stomach that the break up was imminent. Glass puncturing my insides, as if my mind wanted to escape my body and perish - suffer. I knew it was coming and I had entered grief, beginning with Denial.

Everything I do for myself is unhealthy. I smoke cigarettes, and I smoke cigarettes because it's all I can do. I'm stuck in a horrible routine of waking up and smoking, and starting my day off horribly. If I don't have a cigarette, I feel incredibly uneasy and agitated. I hate feeling alone and I always need to keep my hands busy, but I can't keep my mind on a constant for too long of a period.

I guess my main bother is that I'm back to where I started. I'm barely working, and when I do, it's 4-5 hour shifts max. I want to be the person that could actually be good enough for her, but do it for myself.
Having a motivator like that is such a bleak way to look at it, but with my ADHD clashing with constant anxiety (fear of leaving the comfort zone) and heavy depresssion (fear, or a dehumanizing acceptance of loneliness). I'm struggling to feel anything other than shame, regret and hatred for myself. 

I wake up in the morning and watch a TV show because I have nowhere to go or nothing to do, that coupled with no air conditioning in the top floor of a sizeable house and having to resort to leaving the window open, leading to breathing issues because of this country's ecosystem falling apart due to bushfires; it really becomes too much. I'm reaching a point of acceptance of suicide because nothing seems to be getting better, no matter how hard I try.


I guess the real question I have, is where do I start? My ADHD, depression and anxiety are completely separate issues, but all merge togethed to become one painful, existential dread, and I want it all to end.",Stressed

I just send memes, have like two sentences of conversation and just cry a lot when I can't sleep or sleep for over 15 hours and get up for school the next day. I won't sleep for 2 days because if guilt for telling my friend I consider to be my brother that I want to run away and kill myself yet again then I drop off the talking and just send memes again.

2168,"I carry a big burden inside me  My parents are great people, always caring for me and trying their best.  But, especially my mother, was only supportive on the things that SHE thought were good for me, i.e.; education.  From when I was 13 to 16 years old we were always fighting, every day, because I was playing a lot of video games and I hated school, I never studied anything (for some reason though I was doing really good at math :P ).  We even visited a therapist as a family due to our fights.  Things got a bit better but not that much.  When I because 16,  I even self harmed, I told my parents about it (I read online that if you self harm you should ask for help and so I did, yes, it was really hard to tell my parents about it, but i had cut my self really deep once and I needed to go to hospital).  I went to therapy and fortunately I didn't have a mental illness (I even visited a psychiatrist), but  I needed help and so I stayed for 1,5 years.  During that time (high school),  I suddently developed a big love for physics and mathematics - I became from worst student in school to a top one in those 2 subjects in a matter of months.  Suddently, the teachers in school were treating me differently (even those who I didn't study their subject), our classmates were treating me differently (They stopped making fun of me and moking me, yes I was being bullied for some time), I found a gf who was 2 years older than me and I got a reputation for it (she was pretty hot), and last but not least, my relationship with my parents became better.  That change happened over the course of 1,5 years.  By the time I was in the last year in high school everything was pretty good (though i broke up with my gf, but that turned out to be great as I found a beatiful girl that makes me blissful).  I'm now studying aboard in one of the top 10 universities of UK, Theoretical Physics.  Pretty amazing how things can change in a few months/years.  From a kid who fought with his parents and was bullied, was an awful student and didn't know what to do with his life to someone who now studies Theoretical physics.  You could argue that my life now is pretty great, and it is, I'm happy for that, and my parents did a great job to have me here, I'm very thankful to them.

But you see, there is one thing that makes me extremelly sad, and that is, knowing that nothing of that was ever going to happen if my passion was something that didn't have to do with education and school.  I was fortunate to have a passion in physics and people respect that.  My mother would never support me if i told her that I wanted to do something that didn't have to do with ""education"".

I've lost hope in people and feel like a burden  I had a trauma 2 years ago when i came out to my muslim family and they didnt accept me being gat and started being abusive and wanted me to go to conversion therapy so story short we're not in touch anymore because i chose to be myself and stay away from them because theyre really toxic as well. Even though i feel relieved now that i have freedom, i have no people in my life. I have no family. I was really hopeful after i cut my relations with my family and started to meet a lot of new people in a new city. I discovered last year that I have the criterions to BPD but they didnt give a diagnose of it because im young (19M) (which is stupid in my opinion). I also have major depression and GAD. I might have ADHD as well. 

I got to know a lot of people last year but it didnt work out with them (as friends) because they were troubling people. I got to know a one good friend at some point and it went good but in December she sent me a long message that im really burdensome and annoying to her and that i ask a lot of questions and suck out the energy out of her because i talk about my issues a lot and sometimes am negative. So at the point we have known each other for almost like 10 months and she told about all of those issues suddenly after that time. I asked why she didnt tell me before and she told me because she tends to just please people and not talk about what bothers her until she bursts off like that. I told her that she didnt need to help me with my problems and its okay if they are tiring her but she needs to tell so i dont talk about them as much. I was making a compromise with her but she just didnt reply my last message and we havent talked since. 

Another issue is a relationship that lasted one month last year. It was from august to september. We really liked each other and everything looked like its going good. I was putting all of my effort into the relationship and my ex wasnt putting much effort because he has a lot of stuff going on in his life. School and work. Im on the other hand pretty much on a sick leave. Been for a long time now. Im going to therapy and taking medication. I would get a lot of anxiety about my ex really liking me because he would not ask a lot about me and would seem kinda passive. I got my energy to talk about it with him at some point and we ended up breaking up because he sayed that thats just the way he is. I felt really unloved. We broke up and i wanted to get back together after a while. I told him that its okay that he doesnt want to put as much effort and he doesnt need to change anything. He didnt want to get back together because he doesnt have the effort for our relationship (basically hes saying that im a really big burden indirectly). He said that he would have the effort to another relationship but not our relationship.

2179,"(Anxious depression) I feel like my S/O doesn't get me, and I feel like a burden  Hi,

I've been struggling with gradually worsening depression since the beginning of the pandemic, and as those of you who struggle with it know it comes with feelings of self doubt, self loathing, physical exhaustion and lethargy, not being able to do much, not being able to focus. So I haven't been going out much, and I haven't been seeing anyone but my boyfriend. And he's working on weekdays, and takes care of his daughter on the weekends. So he's a pretty busy person who has his shit together, when compared to me. He's been very supportive and he's the one that encouraged me to start seeking professional help in the first place. However lately I feel like he sees me as a disfunctional person who ""does this to themself on purpose, as self sabotage"". Well yes, but I don't want my mind to be self destructive either, I wish I could control it. Anyways. Today I called him when I was feeling overwhelmed, and he told me I should get out of the house, not do this to myself, go out and see some friends or at least take a walk. I know he intends well, but I felt so misunderstood, and as if he sees me as a child, a disfunctional being that requires ""a push in the right direction"". (He's also 10 years older than me, so this part has become an extra insecurity during these fragile times.) I already hate being in this situation and wish I was in the place to go out and do stuff, and occupy my mind with things other than my insecurities, past, future, etc. I just feel alone, and as if nobody around me truly understands me. It's extra lonesome during the pandemic because a lot of my friends have gone to their hometowns while I stayed in the city where I go to college.

I'm basically only scraping by because my friends and family insist they'd be devastated if I died... but those same friends and family say that I'm a mooch and need to overcome my mental and physical disabilities and be self-sufficient, because they can't deal with me as I am. But I can't, and even if I could, I really don't care enough to *want* to... literally the only way existence seems remotely worthwhile to me, is if it's not any more difficult than it currently is.

It's entirely a choice between the latter two, shitty options.

And I get told that I'm wrong no matter which one of those two options I try to choose. If no one likes the me that IS, then they can't expect some magical idealized version of me that ISN'T... so why not just accept that, and let me choose the option of ceasing to exist altogether? I'm so fed up with only having those two, shitty choices, and still being told that NEITHER is acceptable -- that the only acceptable choice, is a fake, imaginary one.

So I'm in New England right now, it's starting to get dark really early and I think the seasonal depression is starting to set in. I work part time while doing my online classes for college. Ironically, school hasn't stressed me out that much lately so that's nice. And recently work has actually helped as a distraction and kept me with a schedule, although it is tiring. 

My sister is in between jobs right now and she has a lot of payments to make so I'm really worried about her. I'm in a position where it's really hard to save money cause of gas and food so having to provide for my sister right now is a little stressful (I'm a broke college student lmao). 

Now on to the biggie. There's this guy that I've been hanging out with and the situation is really odd. It was dumb and I'll never do it again. But we had decided since we weren't really super compatible and that we have different goals, we wouldn't pursue a future together in that way. And at some point we had discussed exclusivity because we had only been seeing each other. But then we decided to not do that anymore. Which at the time I was like whatever idc, I'm not planning on finding other people to sleep with. But I made the mistake of thinking that he wouldn't either. 

Fast forward to this week. He tells me that he has a friend visiting this weekend so I couldn't come over. I was a little bummed because it's Halloween so now I'm pretty much just going to work and then do school work instead. But then on Wednesday I was having a hard night (suicidal ideation ish not thinking of doing it just being very tired with life). So I messaged him to see if he was still awake and he called me. I told him about why I was crying cause he kept asking, I really just didn't want to be alone with my thoughts when I didn't have to. Anyway, shortly after in that same conversation THAT was when he decided to tell me that the friend who is visiting, is a girl. And I was like...okay? That's fine...But I knew there was a reason he was saying that. So I asked ""are you guys going to fuck?"" And he said ya. At first I was like okay whatever, we're not in a relationship blah blah blah whatever. 

But then the next day it kept nagging at me and I ended up having a panic attack at work. Then today I had another one about an hour before work. We argued a bit and I just don't like how he looks at it. I explained to him why I was getting upset and he just didn't seem to give a shit. I feel like even tho it technically isn't cheating or anything, it's still shitty and feels wrong. Idk it makes me feel like I'm being pushed aside and used. I just idk the whole thing sucks and I'm angry with myself for getting into this situation. Because to me the loss of exclusivity meant that like he'd probably still be using dating apps (although he said a few times that he wasn't using them for the mean time), and that if he did meet someone they'd go out on a date. But the friend that's visiting is an old friend from when she went to school up here. Apparently they've had sex before so he's assuming that they'll have sex now. But that it's just casual and he's not going to date her. So to me it doesn't make sense. He's also said before that I'm not allowed to go fuck another guy, but I can fuck a girl. AND he said in that phone conversation that if I went and fucked another guy he'd feel a little weird. Yet he can't understand why I feel weird about this. So ya I'm a dumbass...anywho

editing to say that I enjoy hanging out with him a lot. But I worry that if I keep hanging out with him after something like this that it's me being a dumbass.

2190,"Will I be a burden to my boyfriend if I confess to him that I self-harm and often feel really low?  (I originally posted this on r/relationships but it was removed since it's not the best sub to post this kind of stuff on because people can get nasty over there. So I am posting it here instead, which was one of the recommended subs. Just adding this note to explain the relationships slant of the post.)

This isn't a new thing - since I was 12 or 13, I would feel low for months at a time and started self-harming (though nothing that would leave an obvious or serious mark). In my early twenties it got worse for a couple of years and I'd constantly have thoughts about suicide etc (but I don't think I would ever act on them). I never went to therapy because of the money and also because I didn't want my mum to know (she over-worries about me already and thinks that there's no reason to be depressed unless your life is awful, and that most people who go to therapy are just soft/weak).



I kept all this to myself over the years because I didn't know how to tell my friends and family and didn't want to worry them, plus I didn't think there was any point in telling them. My current boyfriend is the only person I've told about self-harming in the past and about feeling low sometimes, though I didn't mention the suicidal thoughts.



Things got better last year when I was dating my ex. He would go overboard with his affection and we'd constantly text each other (probably an unhealthy amount). One day I woke up to 59 messages from him because he couldn't sleep, so he was telling me random facts, and how much he was thinking about me and couldn't get me out of his mind. I know that it was excessive, but the constant validation was comforting in a way. Even when things went downhill because I was insulted by some sexist/racist/etc things he would say, I would feel stress/dread, but I didn't feel sad. After we eventually broke up for good, I felt numb, like all emotions were muted. Funnily enough, it was the ""happiest"" I'd felt in a while because feeling nothing meant I couldn't feel that sad either.¬†



The numbness didn't last too long though, and my emotions started to kick back in when I started dating my current boyfriend late last year. For the first few months, I was happy and content basically all the time. However, in the last few months, those old feelings have been coming back. I've self-harmed a handful of times, and sometimes I start feeling awful out of the blue -¬† my chest will hurt with emotional pain. Even while I'm at work, I've had to sneak off to the bathroom a few times because I don't want anyone to see me crying for no reason. The sadness comes over me a few times every week - though it is not as bad as it used to be.



Sometimes it comes for seemingly no reason. Sometimes it's triggered by my insecurities around my relationship. The trigger can be something tiny and ridiculous.



I know that my insecurities play a big part in how I feel - I will start worrying that my boyfriend is losing feelings for me. I've spoken to him about my insecurities and he does his best to reassure me and be supportive. I don't like to let people see me cry, but he has caught me crying a few times, and he'll hold me until I start feeling slightly better. He once said he thought it was odd that I had these worries because he loves me so much.



I don't tell him every time I feel low - only when it gets bad, maybe every couple of months of so, and even then I try to downplay it to him. I haven't told him I've been self-harming again.¬†



I'm not sure if I should tell him how bad it can get, and how often it comes. On one hand, I don't want to worry him or be a burden, and I don't want him to get sick of me always being mopey. On the other hand, he's told me I can tell him anything, and it might be a relief to finally confide in someone who is close to me.



Do you think I should let him know, or keep it to myself? In your own relationships, have you found it healthier to share burdens or exclusively work on them yourself?¬†


(Also just a note that even if I do end up telling him, I would not expect him to ""fix"" me or anything like that - I recognise that it is my issue and I have to work on it.)

As I plan to pay everything slowly, having USD 4000 would give me the breathing space to not drown and find the will to work every day and pay the remaining back to banks in the next three years.

2196,"I feel like a burden to others and when they realize that they'll eventually leave me  A little history about me. Had a rough break up about 1.5 months back. Currently doing a mediocre job where I'm not appreciated really. Things don't go according to plan. But here's something that I came to realize.

I'm dependant on people. It's like I mooch off their lifestyle, not by money or anything. It's like I want to be included in their plans since I've hardly got anything going on my own. Don't get me wrong, I have a ton of stuff I should be doing but they kind of fade out.

I'm afraid that if they find out that I'm just a hack and they could be better off without me, they'll eventually forget about me. Like my two roommates can find a cheaper flat without me (they settled for a costly one when I wanted to move in), I was driving when I had an accident with one of my closest friends (and both of us got injured, me more, but his injury is still on me), my work colleagues enjoy more when they party with others than when I invite them over etc. Even when I am invited to some gatherings, I feel all I contribute is the occasional laughter or nodding or denial.

I've noticed I was never able to positively contribute to someone else's life. It's as if I'm sucking the luck out of them. I'm not openly negative though, I have a normal everyday outlook in front of others.


I've noticed at times I'm really energetic to go on long trips and at times I'm really sad. I can't really open up in front of others as people will judge me and it's not a norm here to go to the psychiatrist unless you're mentally handicapped-you'll be branded as such and made fun out of if people find out. Or if I confide in the wrong people they'll just brush it off as sadness or they'll try to distant themselves cuz no one likes a nutcase, right.

Learning and growing is just slight changes to our nervous systems over time by naturally going through life‚Äôs circumstances. We really are so amazing our minds process every bit of information around us using our senses to record so that we can become already more than what we are. That is if we do everything right. We so often do things that damage our systems by reacting the same way to a situation than we have previously in a negative way. We study our own behavior so that we can improve in later similar occasions. Know when you‚Äôve done wrong, and know when you‚Äôve done right. Keep trying and doing new things along the right path and your body and mind will literally change to be the way you believe and want to be. It‚Äôs best to literally avoid thinking about anything that can‚Äôt in one way or another improve your thoughts and feelings on a certain topic personally individualized to each and every one of us, curated over a lifetime of interpersonal events happening to all of us at all times all at the same time. Some things that happen in life have such a big impact on this process it stunts our growth as people. Repeatedly reacting to any negative situation with the same mindset. Some people think therapy can help tap into whatever core situation caused it but that may only work if we have the memory. Some people can‚Äôt remember the event that shocked their nervous system enough to create them to be a certain way. I think fully understanding this concept might be the best way to self healing and growth. Tell your nervous system or mind it‚Äôs wrong.

2204,"Post nervous breakdown   I'm have to wait till the end of the month to fully talk to my therapist about this. But like, has anyone experienced a severe shift in mindset post a serious nervous breakdown?

I've had issues my entire life. Abused and neglected by my parents and a smorgasbord of disorders.
I (22NB) in mid January, after another really terrible year of not really going anywhere with my life and being actively abused by my controlling mother who, due to mental health and her control, made it impossible fore to get away. I just finally broke after several of my friends started telling me I was becoming a burden to them and weighing them down.
And I'm different. In a month I have just. Changed. I enjoy doing chores, I have energy and want to do things, I want to go out I want to see people I get bored sitting at my computer to many hours when I used to sit there for basically 10-14 hours every single day.
I didn't like. Choose to actively change. I've been medicated since long before this nervous breakdown but the meds were seemingly not helping, but this nervous breakdown just. Slipped something into place?
I am cleaning my parents house and yard, and I am enjoying it. I have never in my entire life felt any sort of accomplishment or satisfaction after doing a chore, and now I feel immensely satisfied with myself when I finish a long busy work task.
And yes, I considered how this could be some kind of Mania, but my Mania has never lasted this long, and I am still having rare VERY low mood moments sometimes, but most of the day I felt very relaxed and positively looking on life.
And yes, I have started laughing at my mother's pathetic bullying now. I no longer give a single shit about her as a person or what she has to say about me. She will do the same thing she did all last year, greet me downstairs at 8:30am blazing mad that I'm ""awake this early"" and I laugh at her. 

I just. Is this normal? This has been a constant for over four weeks, does severe nervous breakdowns change your brain chemistry? Or did some part of me change and decide to let go of caring about others opinions of me? I can't find information on people having a positive time almost immediately post nervous breakdown.

Hello I (f21) am a new Reddit user so forgive me if this post isn‚Äôt up to guidelines/format. 

I was diagnosed with autism and depression when I was 8 and I‚Äôve been medicated for most of my life since then. For many years I was in SSRIs. Then around 14 my depression and anxiety got worse so we started trying other medications. I don‚Äôt remember how many or what kind, I just remember none of them working and causing me horrible side effects. I even once tried to take my own life. Finally around 16 I started college, my home life calmed down a bit, and I was back on Celexa. Since then I‚Äôve been prescribed other medication for anxiety/adhd but those have all worked well together. 

Well tonight I am starting a new medication in place of the celexa, an SNRI called Pristiq. I am already scared as I feel my mental state is declining once again, but I‚Äôm also terrified about starting this new medication. I‚Äôm scared of the potential side effects, how they could impact my personal and professional life. I‚Äôm a server so laying low/nesting while working from home is not an option.

2210,"How to STOP Nervousness EFFECTIVELY  Nervousness is something we all experience at various points in our lives. Whether it‚Äôs before a big presentation, a job interview, or a social event,  
  
I remember one time I had to give a speech in front of my whole class. I was so nervous, I couldn‚Äôt even say my name. And That‚Äôs how powerful nervousness can be.  
  
You might already know some common ways to deal with nervousness, like taking deep breaths, chewing gum, or thinking positively.  
  
But while finding a better solution on how I can overcome nervousness, I found a great research study on the neuroscience of Visualization.  
  
Now, you might be wondering, how can visualization help with nervousness?  
  
You see, Visualization is the process of creating mental images or pictures in one‚Äôs mind.  
  
It involves using sensory information and the imagination to simulate experiences and situations that feel real despite not being physically present. And research has shown that the brain often can‚Äôt tell the difference between a visualized image and actual reality. This means that when you visualize a specific action or outcome, the same areas of your brain are activated as when you actually perform that action.  
  
If you want to have a better understanding on how visualization helps to overcome nervousness, I have created an animated video to share what I learned.

Bit of context. I'm in my mid-30s and live in Germany. I've been diagnosed with depression two years ago and therapy since has helped a ton. I do however still have massive issues with my daily rhythm (including sleep and eating) as well as just getting through my work and chores.

  
I have immense problems concentrating on anything that doesn't immediately catch my curiosity. I feel like I'm both lazy and can never relax. I'm fighting to get anything productive done through the background noise in my head. I can't keep a daily rhythm going for more than a few days.

  
That sounds pretty ADD to me. And so I'm getting tested two weeks from now. But I'm incredibly nervous. When I got diagnosed with depression, it gave me something concrete to fight against. And the help I got in doing so was invaluable. I'm scared I won't get that a second time.

  
The problem is that my history doesn't sound like that of a typical ADHD patient. I can sit still for way too long, at least for the past 10 years. I did very well in school, even got moved up a grade to stop me getting bored. University was less good, with a lot of last-minute hand-ins.

  
I'm scared that I'm not ""ill enough"" to get help, or that my troubles will just get chalked up to depression symptoms. And I'm certain it's not just that.

I want to scream, cry, and act on my intrusive thoughts. However, when i'm around someone, all of this happens in my head, knowing i could act on it alone. And it's SO frustrating. 

I'm actually starting to hate people around me because I know it's because of them I can't do those things. Hell, even with my boyfriend, the most I could do is cry and I can't even tell him why because so much is happening in my head it becomes fuzzy (even if he knows about my problems). My body just don't allow me to feel when i'm with another human being, i don't know why.

I have adrenal fatigue , hormone issues, insomnia, panic attacks, a tremor when I‚Äôm scared and severe crying spells to the point of y face and eyes swelling and I lose my voice from crying and have a migraine for a day or two after).

I‚Äôm on the floor the entire time just trying to get ahold of myself. Being tired and weak and alone made it so much worse.

I‚Äôm sorry if you don‚Äôt understand how your behaviour affects others . I‚Äôm getting depressed , physically ill from never ending worry about my daughter
I can‚Äôt recall ever hearing anything positive from you 
Fix what ills you 
You‚Äôre always sad or upset . You‚Äôre living negatively in a constant state of worry or fear

Can I tell you this or does it offend you.  Then he hung up.

Later he texts 

Then dedicate yourself to happiness . When you hit a wall , walk around it . Forgive , help others , find the ambition to be happy , successful and content. Overlook the petty grievances we all have . Have pride in you accomplishments.  Accept the differences in others. Lock your insecurities away. We don‚Äôt have to please everyone . Be humble .  .

My family and my ex all wanted to blame my lack of meat on my problems instead of understanding I‚Äôve been open and honest about my struggle with my mental health my entire life.

I don‚Äôt want to live anymore and I‚Äôm also scared because I don‚Äôt want them to be in control of my body if I can‚Äôt do that properly.  I am really grateful for my life and the lessons. 
I don‚Äôt know how to care for myself and to care for others. I never had a parent in my life who nurtured me and so the comment about regressing really hurt as well.

So basically the nervousness has been going on since middle school. The last time I was confident was 6th grade, and after that I kinda went down a rabbit hole. I just basically turned into a robot collecting points, such as high grades or approval. I never felt like myself. Every social interaction felt extremely painful and awkward.

I guess things somewhat gotten better since I'm in college. I experience less shame and distress, but I still have a lot of restraint when I'm interacting with anyone (Although I still feel confident with family). I turned this way probably because if I be myself, I will act inappropriately or immaturely. 

However, I know if I continue to be so restrained or inhibited, things will never get better, and things don't have to be this way. When I see other peers, they seem to interact freely, the exact opposite of me. I'm not saying it's everyone, but just in general. 

Here are some ways I'm trying to end this long reign of nervousness:

1. This I feel like it's a bad idea now but I tried to do it before. It's that I need to achieve a certain state of confidence before I go out and interact. If I'm in a state of confidence and there's an absence of anxiety, I can talk to a lot of people and make a lot of friends!
2. I'm trying just to force myself to be less restrained and inhibited, and see for myself whether people judge or not.
3. Trying to open up to people about my feelings, perhaps they could empathize with me. (Which is what I'm doing here too lol)

Hopefully, my story makes sense... and please let me know what you all think.

2224,"Did I have a nervous breakdown?  I lost my mom in July and have been taking it pretty hard. I don‚Äôt show it externally because I don‚Äôt want my family to worry. I lived with my mom and sibling and took care of my mom in her final years and would text her all day if I was out of the house or spend an hour on the phone with her. 
Anyway, I made some goodies for a friend and took a picture to send to my mom before realizing she wouldn‚Äôt respond. After my friend‚Äôs party and driving home, I started crying about how I couldn‚Äôt talk to her anymore or show her what I made. 
I started crying uncontrollably and had to pull over even though I was two streets away from home. It was like I blacked out. Screaming, crying, the whole snotty nine yards. I left my friend‚Äôs house at 9pm and it only takes me ten minutes to get home, but it was after 10pm when I walked in the door. I have no recollection between pulling over and getting home. I explained it to my therapist who said it was a just an emotional response but it was so overwhelming and I‚Äôve never had that feeling before.

2226,"Noisy Neighbours Make Me Nervous  I'm a nervous person in general, but the noises that neighbours make can drive me nuts. Let me add some context.

Five years ago or so I was living with my family in some flat, and there were two alcoholics downstairs. They'd fight once a month or so, but thankfully we couldn't hear them too much. So that wasn't the issue. A year after we moved to another flat, and for two years it was real quiet most of the time, so it was good. A couple of years later, I've moved to a different city, and rented an apartment. I've got very unlucky: there was a crazy neighbour. An elderly woman could scream for no apparent reason at 4 o'clock in the night, start banging the pipes, you name it. I've lived there for a year and then moved again, because it was driving me insane, and nothing could be done about it. I've moved to a different flat, and here I'm also constantly worrying about neighbours making noise. And the noises are somewhat weird sometimes, but I guess most of peers, my relatives and my parents wouldn't even hear these noises that well. Btw, the problem is that I'm young and have a pretty good hearing still. No, noises are not in my head only, I've recorded a couple of times when it was ridiculously loud and some sh*t would happen.

So, the issue is that I become anxious when I hear neighbours making noises, especially at night or if I'm falling asleep. 

They shouldn't make noises at night, but oh well... I've got to admit, they're WELL within the norm...
But personally they're making me anxious...
Sometimes it sound like they're moving furniture...

This night, I've slept in earbuds and listened to music, and the music was loud enough so that I wouldn't hear them, and I slept well. 
I know it's not healthy, it's not gonna work every time... I've tried to be really calm and relaxed and not care about these noises, but I just can't ..

2227,"Attachment Style - ""Deactivation"" Nervous System Issues?  Okay I'm just gonna TRY to keep everything brief...  
I was with my partner for 2 and half years in a committed loving relationship, we lived together felt safe and this person was so loving and caring and always so supportive, something triggered me I think it may of been perceived abandonment, and my anxiety got so bad, I then started become sensitive to things like their tone of voice changing or if they seemed off, I would feel really upset and scared.  
A few days after I started getting intrusive thoughts telling me ""you don't love him"" and this made my anxiety sky rocket, and with that I then notice I couldn't feel my feelings for this person and they quickly seemed like a stranger, I couldn't feel love everything was just replaced by this anxiety.  
I kept on for 9 months just living each day hoping it would subside but each day became harder with feeling chronic stress & anxiety 24/7 I was in full fight or flight (so overwhelming) and I was throwing up bile most mornings, could hardly eat and eventually found it hard to function spent most of my days OCD scrolling online trying to figure out what was going on and wanting these symptoms to stop, I tried hypnotherapy and meditation and changed my SRRI's but nothing could relax me, it's as though since that trigger my nervous system decided that this relationship is now a threat.  
I couldn't take it after 9 months and decided to split up (this is in the past week) and I felt so awful for this person because they didn't understand and neither did I what was going on, but as soon as we broke up I had immediate relief from these symptoms, almost like my nervous system was like ""Okay great we escaped the threat! you can now chill out""   
I hated that this happened because this relationship was so wonderful for me and we brought out the best in each other and it hurts me to know that he's hurting from this, I wish I could go back to how I was, like I can tell my nervous system is still perceiving it as a threat and if we were to get back together those symptoms would just re-emerge, (I suppose this was some kind of deactivation)  
I'm doing EMDR with a therapist, but is there anyway I can teach my nervous system that this person isn't a threat? I know I've probably made it harder now for that to happen since I left the relationship, but I just want to know if there's possibly anyway? ",Stressed

If I'm bored even, I'll find myself doing it. 

I don't pick at my skin directly so bad, or scratch or anything personally. I haven't had as serious or full blown an issue with it I suppose? I've seen degrees of it in others I've known with certain stages of mental health.

I wonder how others deal with similar issues themselves.

A lot of what I struggle with can be symptoms for a few different disorders (bad mood swings, anxious feelings, etc), and I'm pretty sure I'm neurodivergent in some way, but I'm not sure where I fit. I have some problems with attention, I kind of need to multitask to be able to keep focused on certain things, I tend to obsess over any new hobby or interest and then stop all together when I lose interest, and I have a lot of trouble remembering things I need to do, and I also have sensory issues, freak out more than is normal when plans shift or a plan isn't set or if there's a bigger upheaval (like moving), and I have a lot of trouble in social situations, but I did well in school, don't have too many issues with getting completely and totally sidetracked during a task like cleaning, and I don't think I have a special interest.

2243,"New to psychedelics, nervous and looking for best practices‚Ä¶  Many years ago, when I first started exploring psychedelics, it was challenging to find a trusted site that laid it all out for free. I have also been dismayed by psychedelic clinics charging thousands of dollars for psilocybin and ketamine. So I decided to create entheo.org - free trusted resources that lay out best practices. 

Entheo is perfect for people that have been hearing or reading about psychedelics but are a bit nervous about everything or unsure where to start. I made these guidebooks for preparation, the journey day, for the trip sitter, and integration that are bloody fantastic. I have pulled in everything, laid out best practices, and made it really easy to go through. 

Some of things in the preparation guide book include a medical screening checklist, journaling prompts for reflection and intention setting, how to get your drugs tested, information on dose, and tons of other stuff. Experienced psychonauts may still find these resources useful, but this is just perfect for newbies that want to do this safely, for personal discovery or to heal.

I hope you find these guidebooks useful for your journeys. The best thing about these is that they are FREE so good information remains accessible to all.

Am I the only person who gets strangely nervous with the year ending? 2022 hasn't been particularly great for me; it's been a very quiet year of my life, but also a fair amount depressing without the part where I actually feel depressed. It's like heaps of things going on in my life is depressing yet somehow I feel dulled to it and not depressed. I just feel... kind of blank about it. Or maybe I just don't understand the feeling and am interpreting it that way due to it being unfamiliar?, It's confusing.

I shoved a towel into my mouth until I almost couldn't breathe and then I screamed until my throat hurt. Then I cried and after that I splashed water on my face (more like splashed water everywhere i guess there was still some rage remaining)

After I calmed down a little I looked up on google ""did I have a nervous breakdown or am I just an attention seeker"" as always google wasn't helpful at all and showed me stuff that had nothing to do with my question. So I threw my phone against the wall and started crying again. After that i grabbed some scissors to cut myself but it didn't work so i got angry again and threw the scissors to the floor then instead i downed my fingernails into my skin till it bled. 

I tried to calm down again with breathing exercises and then i looked up how long a nervous breakdown lasts and it said a few hours to a few months. Then i looked up what's similar to a nervous breakdown and it said burnout. So i looked up how long a burnout lasts and it said at least 6 months. 

I got angry again and this time threw my phone on the floor. More crying more self harm blah blah

I‚Äôm still recovering from a full mental crisis that lasted about a week. 

I had panic attacks which led to being the highest level of anxiety I‚Äôd ever experienced over the course of the weekend with the feelings that I was going crazy/going to die/etc followed by a rough week and a half of not feeling anywhere like myself, crippling anxiety, disassociation, brain fog, etc, 

Everything subsided anxiety wise and I feel like I‚Äôve processed everything.

2261,"Nervous breakdown at work  Sorry if this is quite long. Thank you so much in advance for reading. 

For context I've been working at my job as a barista in a busy cafe for nearly a year. I have ptsd from previous trauma but had felt like I'd made a great deal of progress. Unfortunately even though I have some great friends at work, the main three managers are incredibly abusive using hateful language and bullying staff regularly with a specific focus on myself and a couple of the other younger girls. The second issue is that two of those managers are in a relationship so if either of them do anything wrong or have an argument outside of work, you can't make a complaint and they bring all that anger and aggression into work with them. Fairly recently we had all gone out for a work party and one half of the manager couple (adult male 10 years my senior) had gotten really drunk and forcefully kissed me on the cheek against my will, I felt incredibly uncomfortable and didn't feel like I could get away from him, this all happened while his girlfriend (the other manager) was watching and she's been taking it out on me ever since, and as I rejected his advances and probably in his eyes caused him problems he's also been particularly up and down with me, think typical nice guy behaviour. It has led to me having multiple panic attacks at work and having to take a lot of time off which I have then been told I will lose my job for. This was especially trigerring for me as I had ptsd from a previous more serious SA and he generally reminds me of my attacker in both appearance and behaviour. I tried contacting HR about the managers involved and their response was to... Sit down and have a chat with my manager?
Today after several months of bottling everything up the manager in question turned to me during a busy shift and told me to ""do my f****g job"". I had a cup in my hand at the time and I smashed it on the side (I didn't intend for that to happen) and because I was so shocked by my own actions I felt like I had to double down so I just walked out and told him I quit. This was in a busy cafe in front of customers and worst of all I frightened all of my other Co workers with some of them screaming and I'm not sure but I'm hoping no one was injured by the smashed crockery. I am so so ashamed and frightened of myself, I have absolutely no idea what to do as I can't afford to lose my job and really don't want to but know I've done something unforgivable and mostly I don't know how to make it up to my colleagues. My biggest fear is that I lost control and I have frightened people and I don't want to hurt anyone. I'm not sure if I should try to check myself in to a mental health facility if I'm a danger to others? I had never considered myself dangerous but my behaviour today was completely unhinged. I have no idea what to do. Has this ever happened to anyone else? Is there any way I can rectify this?

I the past, I had just gone to my GP and while they did prescribe some medication, I never felt it helped much. They would dismiss me when I said it wasn't doing much. Before this current doctor I am seeing, I had initial consults with two other psychiatrists via Doctor on Demand, both of whom did not think telehealth would suite my needs. During both of those consults, they said my symptoms seemed to line up with BP2.. something I hadn't considered. 

Anyway, this new doctor just kinda took my word for it when I mentioned what the other psychiatrists said and prescribed me Lithium...I am very anxious to be taking a new medication like this. I have read that there are some difficult side effects and can be toxic if incorrectly dosed.

2274,"How not to be Nervous when Chatting with People  Hi! So I (19F) am looking for any advice/techniques to ensure I don‚Äôt let nerves control the conversation?

Here‚Äôs my reason why. Back at the start of 2020 when I was 16, I had the chance to chat with a young teacher of mine who I had known for years in both primary and secondary school (PE teacher) and was always happy to be around her. I hadn‚Äôt spoken with this teacher in a while, but she still remembered me and my interests which was sweet. Yet this time, I reacted differently to our conversation. I answered her questions, but I came off as disinterested or unenthusiastic. I remember being nervous to speak with her in case I said something stupid, not that she would mention it, she was far too kind for that! And no, she wasn‚Äôt a strict teacher or anything, I had no reason to be nervous during that conversation. This nervousness had never happened before or after that with any other teacher, classmate or anyone - It was weird. 

I thought that maybe had I grown to dislike her for some reason, but when I got home and told my family about my conversation with her, I felt this excited kind of warm feeling in my chest, so that couldn‚Äôt be the reason haha. This conversation held much more significance later, since it was the last conversation I had with her before she passed away in 2021. 
So then I had assumed that conversation had been a teenage thing I had going on, but if for some impossible reason, I got the chance to chat with her again, I would be just as nervous at the age of 19 now as I was when I was 16! Weird right? If anyone knows why that is, feel free to let me know!

So obviously I won‚Äôt be seeing that teacher again, but this has brought a new thought to my attention. Although this has not happened since that conversation with that teacher, I wonder if I‚Äôll ever experience this nervousness again with someone else as I will inevitably meet new people, especially in college and at work. Are there any techniques I should practice because I don‚Äôt want any kind of anxiousness to get in the way of conversations again. Any advice is appreciated!",Stressed

I feel my heart rate shoot up randomly. It feels like when we were nailing down the dosage for my stimulants. I've been very irritable and quick to cry (especially to music). 

Nothing about my routine has changed in the last month. The weather has suddenly shifted from 90s to 30s so I wonder if it's the barometric pressure? I've always suffered from seasonal suppression in the summer (because I'm from The South and the sun and the heat are unbearable) and winter is usually when I feel like myself again.

 I've tried to rest it off, drink more water, clean the house... I used to feel like this all the time, for years. But I came out of it gradually in the last year and a half. Since getting my Narcolepsy diagnosis and treatment life has been getting so much better. But I never learned how to shake this overwhelming anxiety feeling.

Honestly I thought this was over. Like now that my life is starting to actually get better I could remedy this anxious feeling before it gets out of hand. But idk what to do about it. There's no one discernable cause (not that there ever was before) and taking care of my body hasn't really changed anything. 

I'm not sure if I could even discribe accurately to a doctor how I feel. And I've had so many bad doctors it's hard to trust them with something I'm not 100% sure of the diagnosis before going in, or at least can accurately discribe the symptoms.

My mom got diagnosed with Moderate ADHD when she was 16 I believe. But we both suspect that there may be some autism or something because she struggles socially and can't feel things that a lot of people describe.

I on the other token have much worse signs than her, I struggle socially, my mental pattern and way of thinking is completely unique to myself and others I have spoken to with ADHD and Autism.

I also struggle to a server extent of making decisions, I get extremely anxious quite easily, I seem to have Neutral Affect to most stuff (feel indifferent about stuff) and because of this I can't make decisions or I get anxious I am making the wrong decision.

I also have been showing signs of depression for the last 3-4 years. I try not to count covid much because everyone struggled, but I had a hard time before too.

I also struggle to concentrate on almost anything. My way of thinking pisses off and or annoys a lot of people, there are a lot of social aspects that I can't seem to wrap my head around.

But at the same time I am really good at analyzing how people feel, like I tend to not get mad at people when most would, I simply think ""well they may be x"" or ""well I remember being in that place"" or whatever. But I can't analyze my own feelings or anything.

I also struggle to read tone and know when people are being sarcastic unless if it is very obvious. For example my partner, when she is being sarcastic or joking. Her voice and way of speaking doesn't really change so she has to tell me she is joking or being sarcastic.

This is all to say that I have been putting off getting help for many years and I am really nervous of getting tested, there are so many what ifs.

2287,"Is this what a nervous breakdown is? My story plus some tips for getting through it.  I posted previously here about a week and a half ago after experiencing a weekend of extreme panic attacks, feeling out of control, super anxious constantly, negative thoughts about my health and wondering if I was going crazy, went to the ER, while constantly trying to fix it to realize I spiraled more. 

I was diagnosed with Major depressive disorder, GAD, and panic disorder. 

It‚Äôs been 2 weeks now, it‚Äôs been a somber period of reflection and some really hard days. 

3 days ago I almost checked myself into in patient as the negative thoughts and the volatility was killing me. I had good days that turned bad but looking back it progressed. I wanted to check myself in not because I was going to self harm but because I just wanted to give up. 

My anxiety has been the worst in the mornings as well. 

I‚Äôm just now reading and trying to understand what has happened as I process this new life event which has changed me. 

Is this what a nervous breakdown is like? 

Putting a name to it somehow gives me a little relief to help understand as I definitely didn‚Äôt have the symptoms of a psychotic break. 

I do want to say for anyone going through a mental health crisis it does get easier and it does take time as I may not be where I wanted to be by now but I‚Äôm definitely a lot better than where I was. 

I check into an outpatient program on Tuesday which will consist of 9-1pm of group therapy each day, and 3 one on one sessions per week.

Also side note some things that have helped: 
1. I‚Äôve gotten checked out and explored my racing thoughts. I had a constant urge to go to the ER. Well I finally went and that thought is out of my mind, I have a brain MRI scheduled on Monday ($400 at a private no referral needed place) and more importantly I saw my physician multiple times to provide reassurance. I explored the options of what in patient care would look like while assessing multiple places and doing assessments. I know this isn‚Äôt financially feasible for everyone but the idea is to possibly face some of these racing ideas you have when your in panic mode. 

2. Talk to people and let them know what your going through if you can. This was bittersweet because I had people believing and supporting me while I felt like I couldn‚Äôt dig myself out but it helps the acceptance. I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve accepted this for what it was if I hadn‚Äôt talked about it. I still struggle accepting this anxiety, depression, panic disorder vs. blaming it on a physical ailment but talking about it with others is slowly allowing me to accept it and move on.

3. Get professional help, see a psychiatrist and therapist. Also if you don‚Äôt want to wait I‚Äôve learned a little about receiving centers which are 24 hours and allow you to see a nurse and a therapist. Also it doesn‚Äôt hurt to see your GP if you have health anxiety. 

4. Find ways to relax and see what parts of your days are worse. My mornings are the worst so I try to now take it as easy as possible then and try to prime myself to think better vs. spiral. I noticed that the most erratic racing thoughts came in the morning consistently, and had to adjust. Also I now find myself just laying on the floor, listening to lo fi music.

5. Don‚Äôt be scared to tell people that you‚Äôre going through a mental health crisis and you need down time. This takes time, and I struggle so much with it not just being fixed now knowing what‚Äôs going on. Don‚Äôt push yourself too much

6. Label your anxiety and sit with it. I struggle with this as I‚Äôm new to the panic but I try to label it as anxiety vs. crazy thoughts and just sit to prevent myself from spiraling but this is still difficult. 

7. Rest when you need rest, go when you need to go. I‚Äôve taken a lot of downtime trying to listen to what my body needs to process and not push it.

8. Don‚Äôt put yourself in positions which won‚Äôt benefit you. I had an important social obligation on a trip which caused me immense stress and anxiety since I still don‚Äôt feel like myself. It took a lot of pain to cancel going but I‚Äôm happy I did. I got to this place by not taking care of myself. I can‚Äôt make decisions that don‚Äôt prioritize myself in this state. 

End note: I still am struggling every day but they‚Äôre getting better, I still feel the fatigue, I‚Äôm still down 10 lbs in 2 weeks from lack of appetite, I still dissociate throughout the day, I still have thoughts constantly nagging me that my days going too well and it might turn. I still don‚Äôt feel back to myself but I feel a lot better than I did.

2288,"after a nervous breakdown  I had a nervous breakdown 5 years ago. I have been trying to get better since. 

I feel like I broke myself down and now I am trying to build myself back up but I can not get motivated to do it. Where is a good place to start?",Stressed
2289,"Nervous Breakdown or is that just a general term?  I'm so anxious about trying to type this up without making it super long but also wanting to get out enough information that I'm accurately describing whats happening. Let's just say, my day started great. I was intentional about having a good day and was being proactive about reminding myself to let things role off. I was trying to turn over a new leaf and was doing great, it was working and nothing could break my stride. I was determined. Until the pressure and BS of the day became so overwhelming that I cracked. Not just cracked, but completely shattered. I'm trying to figure myself out. Is it a breakdown? Is it bipolar? Surely the intensity I'm feeling isn't normal. I get so jumbled up and down the rabbit hole that I create messes and impulsively make things worse. It's not intentional. I feel like I'm spiraling right now. I'm frozen in though and overflowing with anxiety and can't stop replaying all the things I did or said that I shouldn't have. I can't stop it. I'm ruminating on EVERY LITTLE THING and it's torture. It's effecting my relationship. I just fixate on something then I kill it with overanalyzing. Today destroyed me. My partner made a comment that every day I come home from work I seem stressed and unhappy. I don't want to be that person. So I'm trying. But things beyond my control that I cannot predict seem to always happen, I'm not talking minor inconveniences, but like really shitty bummers, like you got an unexpected phone call that was sad and full of bad news, or a patient at your office decides to call you at 4:45 on a Friday with a medical emergency but refuses to go to the ER, and because of the insurance they have, we have to solve the problem even if we aren't equipped to do so so it's just a cascade of impossible BS for a patient that hasn't even established with your office yet. 
    When something catastrophic happens I have this overwhelming feeling that the universe is doing everything it can to thwart me. Like something messy unfolded at today at work. And it kept getting worse. Then I just get to a point where the floodgates open. And I'm not only upset because what's happening is a bummer, I'm twice as upset because I tried so hard and couldn't make it. I constantly have to ask people when this happens if my responses seem reasonable or if I'm upsetting anyone. Then if I feel like I've annoyed someone or made the wrong choice I just cry and can't stop trying to think of ways to fix it. Then in my attempts to fix it, I make it worse. And I'm fully aware of this and so that makes me feel worse. Then I overdo it and end up over-explaining. But I realize that afterwards, then feel like I have to point out that I know I'm over-explaining. I just create a mess by trying to have good intentions. Coupled with the fear that if I seem bothered or stressed out it's going to upset those around me. It's this feeling that I'm incapable of controlling myself or making the right choices. Then I push people away because I know that gets intense, having someone psycho-babble at you in a circular debate they are having with themself. I constantly feel like I'm going to get in trouble for something or that I brought too much attention to the wrong things. Right now I feel so deflated and depressed. My plan was to come home, be happy, go to dinner with my partner and have a good weekend. Due to something really shitty happening that was not predictable I couldn't maintain. Now my partner is alone in the other room and I'm stressing because I'm worried I'm going to get someone in trouble, or that I texted my boss too many times, and I seemed frazzled for a moment so their disappointed, and I made someone else's day harder, I said the wrong things, and now there's going to be consequences on Monday. Not confirmed but I know I disappointed at least one person today. The constant onslaught of pressure has me now totally wound up, wide eyed and unable to stop overthinking. I'm so disappointed by it that it's just adding to it. Wtf is this? It doesn't feel like just anxiety. I have diagnosed anxiety but this feels more manic and binding. I'm painfully self aware and yet somehow can't have the forethought enough to prevent my own misery. I come from a long line of PTSD, abandonment issues, sexual abuse, and Trauma both in childhood and adulthood. So I'm wondering if something weird is manifesting or if I've just cracked. Physically I feel paralyzed. Emotionally I feel simultaneously numb, sad, anxious, rigid, angry, and obsessive. I get overwhelmed so easily and I wasn't always this way. I hate myself.",Stressed
2290,How do I fix my extremely damaged nervous system after years of constant stress at a young age.  Thankfully I am in a much better environment now it‚Äôs not perfect it‚Äôs more about the people but for years and years since I was 10 I have been in  extremely horrible situations it was to the point every day was traumatizing my family has mistreated me to say the least through the years. I feel like I never even got to grow up I now realize me  going through such tremendous amounts of stress that I know could have made an adult lose it already at a young age has caused my brain to now literally stress myself on purpose I think it has to do with regulating my body so when something traumatized me it doesn‚Äôt hurt my body as much but I‚Äôm incredibly depressed and even as I am writing this post it feels like once my brain sees something traumatizing it flashes it on my mind it‚Äôs gotten better by using music but I really need help on how I can get my brain to stop almost ‚Äúbetraying‚Äù itself.

2291,"My body keeps freezing every time I have a nervous breakdown, does anyone experience this?  Every time that I breakdown, it feels so heavy. My body freezes up and my thoughts don‚Äôt stop. I can‚Äôt talk and I can‚Äôt move right. I move too slowly, my brain can‚Äôt say what it needs to say, and I end up making everyone mad.
Last night, I ended up having a nervous breakdown over the fact I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I can‚Äôt sleep easily, I wake up off and on and never can actually sleep good. I have constant nightmares and last night I was so exhausted.
I ended up waking my boyfriend by accident and we fought, he thought I was mad but i couldn‚Äôt focus on telling him in that moment. I couldn‚Äôt tell him directly without just repeating the same words ‚Äúgo to sleep‚Äù
I ended up waking his parents, and his mom screamed at me saying that I needed to communicate better and how I‚Äôm keeping the whole house up.

I‚Äôm hard of hearing, and my hearing is getting worse and worse. I really thought I was quiet, but I wasn‚Äôt. She started to say how it‚Äôs every night I‚Äôm waking them up due to me being so loud. I never knew this. (She said all of this during me having a nervous breakdown)
She never told me I was loud, and she never communicated this with me.
Then, she told me how they can‚Äôt help me, and how I‚Äôm not getting better faster and I need to try harder.
I‚Äôm going through a ton right now. I was kicked out of my home, my family disowned me pretty much, I left a really abusive house hold. And I thought I was getting better. But she said I wasn‚Äôt getting better faster.
She texted my boyfriend telling him how I sleep all day long and he doesn‚Äôt deserve this because he works full time. And that‚Äôs what I told him too, and I tried to tell her this but she just didn‚Äôt listen.
This triggered me a ton. Because instead of her trying to listen, she kept cutting me off and telling me how this was my fault and how I‚Äôm not trying harder. It caused me to just shut down even further. I couldn‚Äôt focus on what she said and I couldn‚Äôt move. My whole body was shaking and I couldn‚Äôt talk normally, I talked very slowly and would skip words I was trying to say.
Is this common? Everytime I tell someone afterwards that I can‚Äôt talk, I can‚Äôt tell them what Im actually thinking, they tell me to try harder, that I‚Äôm letting the darkness win, or that it‚Äôs my fault and I need to put more effort.
But I really can‚Äôt. It feels so paralyzing. My brain won‚Äôt let me talk, my body feels so slow, I can‚Äôt move and I just can‚Äôt say what I need because I‚Äôm so overwhelmed. Am I really not trying harder? Am I just giving up? I don‚Äôt understand, I thought I was trying. But is it not good enough?

I think this is important to note; I‚Äôm diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, ADHD, insomnia, and depression. Does this correlate with my diagnoses? I can‚Äôt find anything online but maybe you guys can help.

2295,"Most of my emotions are anxiety/nervousness and negative  23M

My life is fine, I work just well, meet my goals, talk to people, take care of errands, etc. However, over the last few years I thought I had some baseline anxiety that didn't go away even with exercise, etc.

So I finally tried medication a few months ago. I was on antidepressants for over 2 months and felt nothing. The psychiatrist said I had to increase my Zoloft dose to essentially the highest dose offered 150-200mg in order for me to feel it work for my anxiety. He also said it's one of the best meds for anxiety. 

I said I didn't want to and wanted to continue trying natural methods. So I stopped Zoloft entirely and nothing changed-- I didn't even enter a relapse. 

I was still confused about my emotions and felt out of touch with what I was feeling which I would notice when I made decisions because *I couldn't seem to feel what I was feeling inside* to guide me toward what I wanted. 

So I started reflecting on my emotions throughout the day and I noticed what I was feeling inside was generally nervousness and uneasiness. I already did this a few months ago and I got the same results. 

For example, right now, I'm worried about tomorrow because I have an internal job interview and I have to go in the office and I want to take the right bus. And yesterday, I was worried about being in the cold for 2 hours and paying for car repairs. And the day before I was worried about not having any plans for Friday night. There seemed to be almost always something I was concerned about and No matter how much time has passed I still uneasy and honestly deeply insecure and unworthy. 

I don't know why I still feel like this. I feel sad and alone. I always put in effort to meet people but I feel different at the core and deeply uneasy that they will leave me once they find out who I am which makes me very anxious. I have good reason to not trust people and people misunderstand me and judge me from the outside. I have had people say I'm being rude when I was just really anxious so this adds on to my feelings when I approach someone in public. I feel more misunderstood which adds to my anxiety. Sometimes I can't force my behavior to show the right things. Like I'll space out and they think I'm staring at them, etc.

3 or 4 weeks ago I got my first job and I've been finding that I am extremely nervous every morning before I have to leave for work and even during my breaks I can feel nervous. This gets to the point where I don't feel like eating because of it and go through the day without eating anything until I get home.

This isn't just with that job.  I get nervous when doing most things like sending emails, going to the post office to send letters, going shopping, ect. I feel like anytime I do anything, I have to force myself to do it.

It's the worst when it comes to phone calls/video calls. Every day I know I have to make a phone call I am very nervous and literally get nothing done leading up to it. Whenever I received a phone call, I feel like my heart stops and I have trouble breathing properly. Also, throughout the call I am walking back and forth in the room I'm in (given there's no one else in it).

Now that I've written this I realize how pathetic I am for not being able to do simple things that a normal person should be able to do.

I don't feel like I can tell anyone I know that I feel worried because usually the thing I need to do turns out to not be too bad and I'll look like an idiot. They will also bring it up over the next days and make fun of me for it.

I'm a nervous wreck just thinking about it. The reason why this decision was so hard for me is because I have had severe mental health issues since I was a child (I've been officially diagnosed with severe clinical depression for about 6 years now but I've had them way longer and I also had other issues as a child). 

This makes me doubt myself a lot and also makes me doubt my capabilities.

I even talked in detail with my psychiatrist about this and basically I get very positively influenced by animals and they are extremely important to me and my wellbeing. 

However I never would want to do anything to a pet that would be bad for them. So I keep thinking that I might have a too unstable life to ever have pets on my own (I live on my own). However after careful consideration, taking everything into account, talking to many people who are close to me and know me about it, I think I'm going to do it. I can't wait for my cuddly friends. Pets are one of the only things that help me feel a bit better and a bit more normal. I don't doubt that I can love them dearly and give them all the affection and care that they need. I doubt that I will at some point in my life be having such a bad phase that I can't financially support myself and thus them anymore. It's more worries than actual facts and reality though. I like to think about every possible scenario in detail and this particular one gives me anxiety. Just for my own peace of mind though, I have already asked my best friend if she would be willing to take care of them for a few weeks or month should I ever need, for example, visit a clinic again.

So I've seen a few people come out and say they have had to use the new 988 number, and have had a history of using the old number. They said the new number isn't just a number change but seemingly a change in organization. What I know is the 988 number is not longer the Suicide Prevention Hotline, but the ""Crisis Prevention"" hotline. When you try to go to the old Suicide Prevention Hotline site, it redirects to a .gov site. Here is what I am curious about. 1. If you've had experience with 988 and you're willing to talk about it, did you have a uniquely negative experience? Was there police intervention (as I've heard a few people mention). and 2. Does anyone have resources on if the National Suicide Prevention organization (previous) was a private org or was it government, and which agency managed it? The ""Crisis Prevention"" hotline is ran by SAMSHA, the government agency in charge of services for people with addiction and mental health issues. 

I am concerned this ""number change for convenience"" that was setup by the FCC is also an organization change and that the privacy policies aren't what they used to be. 

If no one responds to this and it goes nowhere. **Please do not let this post invoke any fears for reaching out for help.** If the 988 number feels suspicious to you, there are loads of other organizations that have hotlines.

2311,"mother bringing me towards a nervous breakdown  Hi all,

First post ever. Might be a throwaway a/c. We'll see.

Context first before current issue:
So I've mostly been raised by my grandmother my entire life. My mother lived with us but she was physically and mentally abused by my father before I was born. I didn't know exactly how bad it was til I was older.

When I was 16 my father turned up on the scene again and my mother started seeing him again. Eventually inviting him into staying in the house on weekends. This all despite my grans and my wishes. He smoked, generally destroyed the house and pretty much destroyed all my confidence to the point where I just lived in my room and didn't come out when he was there. She would ignore my grandmother and get angry at her for asking for help. Left her sitting by herself for hours while u was at work and probably much more that I don't know about. This continued for years until it reached a boiling point where he got verbally abusive with my grandmother and In the ensuing argument between he and I, he threatened to have me killed. My mother, despite being In the room at the time denies he ever did this. In fact she denied he ever did anything wrong. They broke up for a little bit then got back together in 2020.

During all this my grandmother was the only person that ever had my back and supported me as much as she could. She had her faults. She overindulged my mother's temper tantrums etc, but I never until recently realized how much she actually shielded me from. 

So... fast forward to mid 2021 and my grandmother passed away. This was a horrible time for me. During the wake (where you stay with the body for a while), which was a somber affair with only my mother, my girlfriend and me there. being that covid was and is very much a concern this was understandable. A nun my grandmother joined us and asked us to say a few words each. My mother proceeded to talk over both myself and gf. To the point that the nun just kinda stood there with this incredulous look on her face. This is the point where I should have realized how bad things would become. I should also mention that despite my gf being absolutely loved by my gran and they had a very close relationship, my mother doesn't see why she has the right to grieve. Also she seems to hate my gf for being not from our home country. 

Since mid April, my mother has proceeded to tell me my grandmother was very disappointed in me. (I know thats not true, she was very proud and only ever asked me to look out for my mum in case she got into trouble). She will start arguments for no reason. If I show any signs of grief she will invalidate my feelings by telling me it was ""her mother"" and that ""she's hurting too"" so I just hide my grief. When she hurts people she refuses to admit she was in the wrong.. this is all regular stuff for me but just magnified 100 fold since my gran died. 

The thing that's really driving me to a nervous breakdown is this.. and I don't know if I can explain it properly. It's the constant hounding and badgering. I work 12 hours shifts and come home exhausted. I'm then accosted the moment I come back to talk about the virus which of course we're all sick of. Issues with her and what she needs me to do or pay for next. I mean this is constant to the point she's waiting for me to get up in the morning to start it and as soon as I get home. It's all the time. She insists I come in to ""chat"" with her, which amounts to me sitting and saying nothing for an hour while she proceeds to talk at me about all her issues and how my gran is disappointed in me. I try to make the effort when I'm not exhausted but the thoughts of going near her sends me into a panic attack. I'm not super sociable usually anyway and being forced to talk to somebody just gives me anxiety. Even if it is family.

The last month running up to Xmas she was constantly reminding me of my grans death to the point I really felt like I was near the end of my rope. I try to set boundaries about conversation and this constant hounding but nothing works. She'll just go sorry you think you're hurt or something to that effect or if I get angry and frustrated I'm told I'm being too hard on her. My gf says it's gaslighting but I've been stuck in this situation so long I genuinely don't know if I'm the unreasonable one or not sometimes.

Theres a light at the end of the tunnel though..my gf and I have worked our asses off and are now buying a house. That's another conversation I'm not looking forward to but will need to be had sometime.

Oh I should mention I did live in the same house pretty much my whole life. Once I hit 18 my gran was getting into fairly poor health so I stayed to look after as best I could.

I usually try to stop as soon as possible afraid I'd look weird and put others in an uncomfortable situation, but sometimes, and this is a bit embarrassing to admit, I play them up, trying to get someone's attention, hoping someone would ask ""are you ok?"", especially since I get them when I'm really stressed so I need some support, but asking for it is... Hard. But sad thing is, no one's ever asked anything, I don't know if no-one's noticed, but I have to admit I feel quite sad that no one has ever come out just to ask whether I'm alright or not, worst part is I don't even know how I would respond, half of me would want to say that ""I'm fine and that they shouldn't worry"" because I don't want to be a bother, but the other side of me would want to immediately start crying in their arms.",Stressed

2316,"I Think I Had A Nervous/ Mental Breakdown today  Hey all. 

The past 2ish months have been absolute hell with work. 10 hour days, working weekends (I'm a consultant/ software dev).  I see a company- sponsored therapist remotely twice a month because I noticed i started to feel depressed, or symptoms of depression. She and I worked on things like mindfulness and the importance of mental transitions between work and leisure. I was down, slightly irritable, but most of time, I was managing. Usually a day off would reset me.

This month things at work have ramped up significantly. More projects put on my plate, more people to manage (I was promoted to a senior position). I work on 7 client projects concurrently in different windows on my PC...I started to just get angry, all the time. I started to have no patience for anyone, they all need to do things faster. When I'm doing non-work things like cooking, it becomes work of ""how do I make this as efficient as possible"" or ""why does my dog take so long to pee"". I no longer have time to eat lunch, I swallow food whole In between meetings because I'm in back to backs. I need my work to be perfect. My father calls my brothers and I and tells us he's having trouble with my mom. Can't focus on that now, not enough brain capacity. 

I don't abuse alcohol, but some nights I have to use it to quiet my brain from being overclocked for ten hours straight. I have panic attacks where I feel like I can't breathe. 

I have trouble sleeping. I feel like I'm going through a fog. I am losing interest in things. My wife says she feels like we're having issues because of it. I sometimes have thoughts of hurting myself - not suicide. My wife now knows this. She is amazingly supportive.

This morning I was on my couch, eating breakfast before logging in to work. My cat comes on my lap and headbutts my bowl. I fucking lose it (not at him), I clench my entire body so hard I pull muscles in my neck and arms. I then just start crying and screaming. I bury my face in the couch and just make strained sounds. I don't recognize this person anymore. This persists for several minutes until I call my therapist. She tells me to call out of work for a few days. I do.  I no longer care about what people might think. 

I'm going to increase the frequency of my therapy. Maybe seek a doctor. Clearly something is going on here. My impression is this is what was formerly known as a ""nervous breakdown"", right?",Stressed

2323,"Nervous Stomach 24/7 for the past few weeks with no end in sight  I really don't know what has caused me to feel this way, but for the past 3 weeks about my anxiety has been at an all time high. I eat maybe 1000 calories a day, sleep in late, and barely do anything because of how debilitating the anxiety is (and also running on 1000 calories a day makes it impossible to workout or exercise effectively). I've lost nearly 11 pounds now (dropped from 158 to 149) in these 3 weeks as well. The only times I have felt this way was when I went through a rough breakup with my ex girlfriend and couldn't eat or sleep for weeks after. This time it's different because it was so sudden and I have no real reason to be feeling this anxious.

I know that it being winter is a major contributor to this feeling, but I've never had it like this in the past. Frankly to me it seems like each winter that passes my mental health gets worse and worse each time, and summer/spring is my time to work on it but it isn't enough time. I make all this progress on myself in the summer and it gets completely thrown away once winter hits, and not by my own doing. This is something far out of my control now, but it never used to be that way so it's a little concerning for me. I used to have a firm grasp on my feelings but now the older I get the more I lose touch with my inner child and who I used to be.

\- Dealing with all of the extremely painful heartbreaks from the past 2 years

A lot of personal problems with my ""dad"", being condemned by past false rumors and many people depend on her a lot on financial issues. (There's more i can list). I'm from Thailand, the economy here is absolutely shit and we are all stressed out.

She has been speaking about the same topic in circles over and over. She has been going on about stress and the other day she was out of her mind and almost hurt herself. She keeps trying to link events that happened and whatever she is saying doesn't make any sense. Me and my mom's friends(?) are worried about her and we are living in her office at the moment. Insomnia is a common thing in our family but right now, my mom has it really bad. We have melatonin but it doesn't help her no matter how strong the dose. Me and the other 2 figured it'd be best for her if she just take a few days to sleep in bed but she is also struggling to sleep

2328,"I don't really get nervous or anxious about things anymore  As a kid, I used to be extremely anxious and nervous about anything that required getting out of my comfort zone. If I had to, I basically became a total mess. I became totally self-conscious, stumbled over my words, couldn't focus on what's going on anymore and  almost passed out (luckily never did).

As time went on, I got used to those things more. We did a lot of presentations in school, I talked with many different people, did many job interviews, so now I don't have problems with these anymore.

However, I know it could sound really odd for me to say that, but... I really miss being nervous or anxious sometimes. Like, I just want to feel a little bit of this again. It kinda made me feel more alive. Now when I get nervous, my heart beat stays normal, I have myself under control and all. It doesn't really feel like I'm nervous at all. I'm not saying I have become confident, because I've definitely not. I'm still very self-conscious and all in public but like whatever I do, my heart beat stays normal...

When I hear others talk about how they're really nervous when doing those things, I can't help but feel envy. They feel so alive doing those things. It's not that, due to their nervosity, that they can't do it, they actually can. And they also tell me that they did a lot of presentations at school and stuff.

It's just that I feel like when I would be with my potential loved one, I wouldn't be nervous at all, and I'm frightened of that... Yes it sounds weird, but I want her to make me feel nervous. When I see her, I want to feel like, oh god, it's her, I don't have myself under control and all...

So over the weekend, I went to the golf range with my dad. I don't like golf, but my dad does. I was just relaxing on the chair playing Pokemon while my dad was hitting some golf balls. I didn't bring my headphones, just in case my dad needs me to record how he swings, I will hear him. Every time he would hit the ball, the impact the ball would make with the club would cause me to flinch. This wasn't like 2 or 3 times. This was every time. Eventually he was done and he decided to get something to eat. 

At the end of the day, I was journaling and I was trying to find a comfortable spot, I was writing on a flimsy table that I got from Target. I kept having to reposition myself. Eventually, I kicked the table a bit too hard and it caused some of the stuff on top to fall, hitting my boyfriend on the other side of the table. In an annoyed tone, he said ""what the hell, man?"" In that instant, I started crying. He didn't mean anything malicious by it. He immediately started comforting me. He knew I was emotionally weak, but I could handle when he raises his voice in annoyance. This was a surprise for him.  I don't know where the outburst came from.

I feel this way when \_\_\_\_\_ happens (this part is the objective trigger, key word ""objective"". To stay with the above example, saying ""you called me a liar"" is much different from saying ""you attacked me"".)

I am feeling nervous and hopeful.

I feel this way when I share an explanation of the check-in format.

What I notice in my body is shallow breathing and a bright energetic sensation in my chest and throat.

I choose to respond by letting go of my attachment to other people's actions and just share the idea.

Of course, nobody really expresses themselves exactly like that. But any thorough discussion about your feelings will have those elements in some form or another.

2344,"Nervous to start Lexapro because or warnings about suicidal ideation, should I be?  TITLE SHOULD SAY ‚ÄúOF‚Äù NOT ‚ÄúOR‚Äù

Hi Reddit,

I (M23) have been dealing with general anxiety and pretty bad social anxiety since‚Ä¶ forever? 

Would also say I‚Äôm a little bit depressed most of the time, though my depression symptoms generally aren‚Äôt as bad as my anxiety. 

I see a therapist but decided, with the recommendation of my therapist, to start seeing a psychiatrist since I have had difficulty coping with anxiety and depression since graduating last December.

I am scared to start Lexapro because of all of the warnings about it leading to suicidal ideation. I am terrified of death and have never wanted to kill myself (the closest to that mindset I‚Äôve been is, on this one really bad day with some traumatic family stuff a few years ago, I would say I was ‚Äúpassively suicidal‚Äù I.e. in the moment I truly didn‚Äôt care what happened to me). But other than that I just really do not want to die. 

Is this shit really just gonna make me change my mind like that (or like, has a risk of having that effect)? Or is that something that only happens to people who already have suicidal symptoms? 

If I really believe in my heart that I don‚Äôt want to die (honestly, I want to live forever lol, I just get frustrated with my disregulated nervous system. Knowing that therapy and medication exist is always enough to give me hope that things will get better), then do I have anything to worry about? 

TL;DR wtf is up with this medication that‚Äôs prescribed to ppl with anxiety saying it might cause me to try to kill myself?????",Stressed
2345,"Nervousness and diarrhea  Hello!

I hope someone can help me with this problem since it is getting worse.

The problem is that I get nervous and with that nervousness the diarrhea starts... It begun a few years ago while I was waiting for someone to pick me up and I thought ""oh, oh, what if I have to go to the toilet when there is none around?""

I feel like this thought got itself manifested somehow because everytime I am about to go somewhere I start to get nervous. Even though I know I have no reason at all to be nervous.
It happens most of the time in the morning, when I need to get my train and when I know that someone is going to pick me up from a Trainstation. 

I think this is something ""head related"" because it doesn't matter what/when I have eaten the last time. I tried not to eat milk-products or to eat nothing after 10 PM and I even tried without Coffee... No results.

Sometimes I can get rid of it if I am busy, for example play a game on mobile... Reading isn't enough to distract myself of the nervousness.

I recently had an medical check-up and the doctors say I am healthy. 
I thought it may be the thyroid gland because I searched my symptoms (nervousness, often/fast tempered) online and often got the result that it could be the thyroid gland. But even the results for the thyroid gland where ok and without problems.

Sorry for the wall of text or if this is the wrong sub but If anyone has an advice what to do or what kind of doctor to visit, it would be much appreciated!",Stressed

2347,"Nervous About New Diagnosis / New Medication  Hi, everyone! First time poster here in need of...I don't know, experience? Reassurance? I'm starting new medication with potentially a new diagnosis, and I'm really scared and nervous, so I thought I would post and see what other people's experiences have been.

A bit of background: I'm a 34F with a long history of mental health issues. My first official diagnosis came when I was 15 (depression with GAD/Panic Disorder), however I started having suicidal thoughts when I was much younger. I also experienced several traumas in my younger years which are what initially led to my seeing a therapist. Over the last 19 years, I've seen multiple therapists, psychiatrists, and social workers, been on many different medications, and had a range of diagnoses. I've also had multiple breakdowns that have severely impacted my life.

Bringing me to now, I began seeing a new therapist last year after several years in remission, I guess. Over this last year my mental health has gotten worse and worse to the point where I feel completely unlike myself. After showing up to my last telehealth appt. with my therapist in a towel and bathrobe (I was really, really low and just could not be arsed to get dressed), my therapist put in a referral to a psychiatrist as she felt that my medications were likely no longer working.

I had my first psych appointment with the new provider today, and she is circling around two potential diagnoses. A) Rapid Cycling Bipolar II with ADHD or B) Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features. I'm currently on 20mg of Prozac and .5mg of Klonopin as needed. Today she added 10mg of Abilify (we're titrating up to it). She really wanted to prescribe me Latuda, but she said that insurance would likely want me to jump through the hoops of trying Abilify and Lamictal first, so that's where we're at.

I'm really nervous about taking Abilify as some of the potential side effects are really serious and it doesn't help that I have catastrophizing anxiety. I'm also nervous about hearing things like ""psychotic features"". I just want to feel ""normal"" again and be able to sleep and focus and not be on this rollercoaster anymore, so I'm willing to try just about anything, but it is still nerve-wracking that it seems my diagnosis gets more serious over time.

So, I guess I just wanted to post and get some words of reassurance from others in the same boat or maybe some good experiences to help ease my mind a bit? Sorry for the TL;DR of it all and TIA for any comments!",Stressed

I came close to ending my life twice this year but told no one about my crisis at the time, and I carried on like nothing happened after those dark nights. Socializing takes monumental effort because I feel worthless and have no sense of identity or anything good about myself or my life to share with people. My mind is in a dark place.

I have not self harmed at all since October but there are still mounting problems and my parents still occasionally bring up my past with self harm which in itself feels like I'm being stabbed.

Lately I've been hearing some ""unexplained"" things and I keep freaking out that I'm having auditory hallucinations but I can't tell if that's true or not. This is a long standing fear of mine so it could be me just overreacting but I'm really afraid. 

A couple times over the past few weeks I thought I heard someone whisper my name, even though no one was. However, each time there were multiple people in the room and a lot of noise so it easily could've been my brain misinterpreting a random sound. Then, last night I heard a crystal clear guitar lick, but there was no logical place it could come from. However, eventually another random noise played and it turned out someone else in the house left their Bluetooth connected in the room next to me. Then, today, I was in the random today with somebody else and it sounded very clearly like they whispered something to me even though they had no reason to(and wasn't trying to talk to me). They have pretty severe OCD and definitely seemed like they were doing compulsions in their head while that was happening, but I've never seen them whisper as part of their compulsions and they seemed pretty with it when someone else walked in the room shortly after. Then tonight, as I was doing the dishes, I heard clearly an authoritative knock, but there's no logical place for that to have come from. Nobody was at the door(the outside of the door is visible from the kitchen). 

I will say that I do live in a house with at least 6 people in it, sometimes up to 12 at a time, so there are a lot of random noises, but these unexplained sounds keep adding up and I'm really afraid I'm hallucinating.",Stressed

If you can push through whatever it is that trying to push you down, hold you back, in this moment, then it **DO IT,** but remember; fearlessness is not the fact of you not having any fear, but despite it,you still **PERSEVERE.**

Something that I get caught up in, is the thought of GETTING THERE, WANTING TO BE THERE, even though I enjoy the process, even though during the journey, that is where you learn everything, I still have to ground myself daily to know that all I have is **right here, right now**. **Give yourself time, give yourself space, it will come with time.**

When we are going through anxiety, when we are going through depression, lack of motivation, a spiritual awakening, anything that causes you to face the unknown there will always be a wave of emotions, of anxieties because of the unknown. This is all normal, there are positive anxieties and also there is negative anxieties. **Embrace how you are feeling and know that growth is on the way, healing is on the way and its happening as you feel that wave of unknown emotions.**

2353,"Advice for a Nervous Wreck?  Im going to be a high school senior this year and I‚Äôm coming out of a pretty awful period of my life. Lots of things have happened the past year and a half that I haven‚Äôt quite adjusted properly to and Ive been recently diagnosed with GED (with some elements of panic and depressive disorders). In the recent past I‚Äôve begun to have trouble concentrating with work despite my desire to do the best I can in school (often at the expense of other aspects of my life) and have found myself easily overwhelmed by the work I‚Äôm faced with. This often gets to the point where I feel paralyzed and unable to get any good work done even if I spend 16+ hours in a day (figuratively and literally) slamming my head against my desk to get something, anything done. At this point, even things I used to find fun and interesting are only stressful tasks to be checked off a list. I often get extremely frustrated at myself for ‚Äòbeing complacent‚Äô if I haven‚Äôt accomplished anything in a day (be that college work, developing skills or even just playing video games/watching tv shows). This, compounded with my feelings of inadequacy and these factors make me feel like I can‚Äôt make any progress with anything. I‚Äôve also begun to wake up feeling numb and empty and often find it increasingly difficult to get out of bed and push myself to do things for fear of failure.I feel as though the colleges I want to get into won‚Äôt take me because my grades have been crushed by these factors. I‚Äôve also become significantly more neurotic and anxious in my interactions with others and often end up tripping over my own words or finding myself unable to talk to others at length. I‚Äôve become much more anxious with other people and have accidentally ruined almost all of my significant friendships and relationships, leaving me with only one close friend to vent to. This has even extended itself into my family. I‚Äôve spoken about so much of this with my father that whenever I seem even slightly off now his tone becomes rough and passive aggressive. He tries to end the conversation as fast as possible (‚ÄúI‚Äôll just leave you alone‚Äù) because he is unsure as to what he can do to help me. Because my ‚Äòmood‚Äô gets like this so frequently I often miss chances to spend time with him and the other members of my family, which makes me feel miserable because I feel like my anxiety is robbing me of chances to develop memories and spend limited time with with my family. Now I feel like its hard to connect with my family because they believe I will just refuse to spend time with them (because Ill be occupied trying to accomplish something or just trying to avoid hurting them by avoiding them when I‚Äôm in a rut) or I‚Äôll just behave erratically and get ‚Äògrumpy‚Äô or upset. I‚Äôm also really hesitant to bring up my problems with anyone I have left to talk to (friends, family, here) because I don‚Äôt want to push people away or irritate them. Unfortunately, when I get angry or frustrated with myself Ive developed the bad habit of self-harm, omnipresent negative self talk and extremely vivid suicidal thoughts and tendencies. I can avoid hurting myself badly pretty well but I often need to find some sort of release to get rid of some negative energy when I find it so overwhelming that it becomes hard to breathe properly. Nowadays all I do is get paralyzed by the amount of stuff I have to complete, other anxieties (like how I‚Äôm not doing enough to help others, how I don‚Äôt deserve all that I have, how I have no talent, the uncertainty of my future), get burnt out due to anxiety and my fruitless attempts to accomplish something and ultimately end up panicking and just wasting days or weeks on end being unproductive (and starting the cycle again). I went through about 8 months of therapy and I‚Äôm not quite sure if I‚Äôve developed good coping mechanisms to deal with everything, sometimes the strategies help but they‚Äôre getting so overwhelming its starting to feel very incapacitating, like the months I spent were worth nothing. When I was in middle school (and early high school) I managed to cope with school and my social life just fine but now I have so much trouble and I‚Äôm not even sure why. I‚Äôm not sure what to do, I feel like I‚Äôm a nervous wreck and the fact that school is 3 weeks away makes me feel like I‚Äôm not capable of making it to college. I feel like maybe I‚Äôm not ‚Äòmentally fit‚Äô for a college or a friend group or a relationship or adult life, that I‚Äôm too erratic to achieve any of those and that if I did, I‚Äôd be too messed up and unstable to handle it. My Dad has suggested taking a year off to avoid the stress of college (‚Äôthat you don‚Äôt need right now) but I‚Äôm not sure if that wouldn‚Äôt just prolong this experience another year. Medication has been brought up in passing but my Dad is against the idea because he believes that it‚Äôs only effective as expensive temporary relief and won‚Äôt help me in the long run. On the positive side, though, my family, remaining close friends, teachers and therapist have been really supportive to me and have given me a roof whenever I needed it.

My nervousness has a physical affect on my body: increased heart rate, nausea, feeling like I need to go to the bathroom(haha), feeling choked up/pressure in my chest (I can breathe). I also tend to overthink situations A LOT.

So I have never really gone into my dark thoughts, mood swings, and etc. I completely trust him, I just know that once I get there I'm not gonna bring it up or my brain will just go blank.

2371,"I am epileptic, can't multiply two digit numbers without having a nervous breakdown or read and keep track of anything longer than a short reddit response without my head spinning. What can I do?  I was diagnosed with epilepsy I think 2-3yrs ago. Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this.

Is this just epilepsy or do I have other conditions now? I have never felt anxiety or stress before this in my life and now at 33yrs old when my mother started explaining, writing stuff down I I had tears streaming down my face within one minute, lied that I knew what she was talking about so I could go sob and squeal and clench my cheekbones behind a closed door. Somehow I can learn some stuff through documentaries and podcasts though, but that's pretty much only history, sociology.

This a nervous breakdown right? I've had three of these things happen, once at a job and a couple times when family members came over. It's not being in a crowded room. I think I had another when they brought me to a concert in a big show indoors but I didn't cry and I'm convinced it was the bass guitar, it was Les Claypool so yeah. About 45mins into the show was when it really hit but I sat through probably a 3hr concert without losing it, just losing focus and lighter symptoms.

I think I used to be smart, I don't think I'm dumb now and I am trying to find a way to do my nosedive at hs night classes instead of signing up, paying a lot for college. My memory is not as bad as it was in the beginning, I think two years ago, even though I can clean my very small bathroom now it takes about an hour and a half or more.

I have tried to push myself up against a wall with two min wage jobs now and got fired from both. Not because of the cash register, I did all I could to avoid that thing and even more to pretend I was doing fine since a bunch of others worked there, nobody was really keeping track. I am lucky enough to have my parents financial support, I dunno what the word is but I live with them too so what I do is always just about testing my brain. I am waiting for my disability case now, but the idea that my mental state leaves me with no chance to progress is horrifying. I tell myself that can't be the case. Trying to multiply pretty much makes it all come crashing down on me, and I have no advice for myself beyond getting back up into my routine. 

If all of this makes sense and you have gotten past it, where are you now? What did you do to get there? I usually don't ask for advice from others but this seems like something I can't make sense of, plan for, or deal with with on my own. Sorry I tend to go on and on and everything seems like it can't be broken down to me, I think because of epilepsy I often can't put my thoughts together in a smaller group.",Stressed

Doing things for the sake of doing things. I kept going carrying with me the tiny hope that maybe things will get better when I finish high school , or when I finish university or when I finally get a job. I thought if I start earning money and be able to do and get things I want life would feel more worthwhile. But here I am, unsure with the career path I chose.

I found it hard to pursue things I want for myself because in the back of my mind I feel like I‚Äôm just going to kill myself anyway so what‚Äôs the point of trying.

2375,"Nervous for psychiatrist appointment  Hello everyone, today is the day I get to see a new psychiatrist. The past month has been getting increasingly worse off for me, suicidal thoughts and all - you get the gist. My therapist suggested I go speak with a psychiatrist because I deep down know easily what could make myself better, but she feels the lingering problems may be more chemical than interpersonal - hence the medication idea and all. 

&#x200B;

I'm pretty nervous about the visit today. The two biggest things stressing me out are the reviews on the psychiatrist I found and medication in general. The reviews online are very extreme one way or another, either 5 star or 1 star, and equal in both fields. I'm telling myself to leave it up to the meeting and if it doesn't go well - I will find another, but this one month wait time and other stress on my current life really put the fire under my ass, so to speak. 

The other is medication. Simple reaction really, I don't understand medication that well and am suspicious of any new ones. My major concerns are permanent side effects and financial costs. God forbid I get prescribed twenty different pills that add up to my entire bank account and make me worse off. Exaggerating sure, but you get the idea. 

&#x200B;

Do any of you have any advice on what I can do to make this appointment go smooth and well for me? I've seen some articles about making a list of what bothers me, what I want to work on, such and such. Also for the medications, are their any resources I can check and possibly tell my psychiatrist that I won't be taking them immediately so I have time to research them?

2376,"I need to vent. I'm having a nervous breakdown and I'm loosing control.  Okay, please bear with me. This might be long, but I promise I'll try to make as short as possible. I am a stay-at-home mom of three boys who are 9, 3 and 2. My boyfriend works very long hours. He works from 8:00 in the morning till usually about 6:00. Usually later. Last night. I don't even think he got home till 7:00 the night before. He didn't get home till almost 8:00 and you know so on. I live in a very small town with no family. I have no friends. My car is also broken down so I have no way to go anywhere, do anything. And with winter we are stuck in the house. We can even play outside really or take a walk. So that means you know I am stuck here with my kids all day by myself. Just stuck in my own head. My boyfriend is an amazing father he really is. He's an amazing dad. Our kids love him so much. But he's not the best support. Honestly. He never has been. He doesn't really understand my mental health issues. We've had the same argument for years. We've been together 5 years. We've had the same argument for years. Whenever I get into one of my funks or whatever instead of like being there for me supporting me he will just push me away. He will ignore me. He will avoid me or he even gets mad at me too. Like last night he lied to me about buying something. He bought a new vape which is fine I just went. I was just wondering if you got a new one and he said no. He did but he bought it from somebody at work. Which was a lie. He ordered it online you know. And I got mad. I got mad because he lied to me because there's no reason to lie about that. And then he asked me why I'm being so petty.  He said I've been petty the last week. We have had problems with him lying to me a lot in the past. He is just a compulsive liar and honestly he can't help himself. I talked to his sister and his sister said that he's literally been like this entire life like he lies about the dumbest things ever. And it's been hard but I have gotten past things and learned to move on and forgive him. I'll try to tell him for like weeks that I'm not doing good. I'm overwhelmed or something and I feel like he doesn't take me seriously or he doesn't care. I mean he says he does. He says he cares. He says thathe respects me and that he understands and all that stuff. But like he doesn't act like he does. And it's gotten to the point that like I've just stopped trying and I've put up a wall and instead of trying I will just hold everything in because.  I'll send him texts and I pour my heart out you know things that are very important to me and he just won't text me back and he won't even like read all of them. And then he complains that we're not close anymore and things like that.  But I never get a break. I never get a moment to myself.  Like I don't know what to do anymore. It's completely like taking over everything like I am usually pretty good about being able to control it and handle it and stuff. But right now I can't. I can't handle it. I'm stuck in my own head and I hate it. And it's getting to the point where I am scared. I don't know what I'm going to do. Like I don't think I'll hurt myself. I know for a fact I won't hurt my kids even though I do daydream of running away sometimes. But I couldn't. There's no way I could. But it's to the point where I'm scared I'm going to just completely lose control and have to end up in an institution or something. I just feel like I am nothing more than somebody who is supposed to take care of everybody and make everybody happy that my needs and my wants are not important and that you know they don't matter. I have to force myself to get out of bed. I have to force myself to do literally anything. I can't even remember the last time I took a shower. Nothing makes me happy anymore. The things that I used to do as my  little self-care things here and there  I just don't even want to put forth the effort in doing it. I have completely lost myself and being a mom and all that stuff. I feel like I'm a robot. I going through the motions. I have depression and generalize anxiety. I've had it my entire life. it wouldn't be so bad if I could get a break here and there. But I'm telling you it has been years since I have had a kid-free day and that was only because I was having my now 2-year-old the next morning. My house is a mess. The laundry is piled up and I don't have it in me right now. Like I can sit there and clean for hours only to have it look like I haven't touched the house in months then the next morning. Because my toddlers are little tornadoes who just destroyed everything. My boyfriend has horrible ADHD and so like he's constantly like starting new projects but never finishing them and never cleaning up after himself. Like he has enough tools to furnish a home Depot. I'm not joking. And he's the most unorganized person I've ever met. And it starts to build up and then that overwhelms me so I avoid it and then it gets worse and then it just the same horrible cycle. And things I should take me. Maybe like 5-10 minutes. Minutes take me 30 sometimes because I have to constantly stop what I'm doing because of the kids. I don't know. I just needed to vent because I literally feel like I might explode.  I've been thinking about taking some online classes so I can do some work from home stuff. So that way you know I have another purpose so I can feel useful. I suppose besides just being a mom.  But even that I'm like why even bother why try because nobody's going to give me the time that I need to do it and then it's just going to be this big frustrating thing. I've been trying to find a babysitter or daycare or something to take the boys for me for like 4 to 5 hours just two days a week so I can get my break and so I can maybe clean and do something. But without a car it's almost impossible. Plus my 3-year-old he is very high energy. It's non-stop from the time he wakes up till the time he goes to bed. He is constantly into everything and doing things he's not supposed to. He doesn't listen. He is the most stubborn and strong willed kid I have ever met my entire life. Like he will sit there and stare you in the eyes as he's throwing eggs on the ground and breaking them. And I don't want to come off as a bad kid cuz not he's actually an awesome kid. He is insanely smart and he can learn things so quickly. He can watch us do something once and remember it. And he has so much energy so I think that's just part of the problem too. He had a little evaluation because he speech delayed and the lady that did his valuation told me to look into Einstein syndrome because she thinks that it fits him perfectly. And they both are basically pandemic babies. You know they've never really been to a babysitter or a daycare or anything. So because of that they have separation anxiety for me and they don't like new people. Because before this I worked as a living manager for hotel. So my family and I lived on site. We lived in an apartment that was attached to the officeand I literally work 24/7. So yeah I just needed a vent. If you got this far. Thank you! Seriously thank you so much for taking the time to read my novel basically lol. I appreciate it very much. I just need to do something because right now I feel hopeless and useless and I feel like I'm suffocating. And I'm tired of it. I'm tired of feeling like this and I'm tired of being short about every stupid little thing. I'm tired of not being happy. I'm just tired of feeling like this. And then that makes me feel guilty. There's just a awful cycle and I hate it.

My wife follows his parents on social media and said that he seems divorced too (last I knew him, he married his highschool sweetheart prior to moving to Atlanta.). She also said that it appears as though he had a mental breakdown, especially given that he's back living with his parents (he's in his early 30s). So I saw him today, and he had a strange demeanor, kinda like a waiter at a classy restaurant. He smiled throughout our short talk, like a waiter smiles...it appeared to be a fake smile that he held for the longest. He was also less outspoken than the guy i knew.

2389,"Compulsive lying as a nervous response?  I've been struggling with this for as long as I can remember and I'm wondering if anyone else has any experience or information about it. I've figured out that I lie because I feel on some level that I'm not good enough, but this isn't a conscious thought process at the time. When I'm having a conversation, I don't think ""I'm not good enough, I need to lie here to make them like me more."" It's more of a compulsion. My lies are always more ""half-truths"" rather than outright lies. I adapt things that are already true and add to them to make them sound more impressive. It's not pre-meditated, so often I don't really know what I'm about to say until I've said it. I also do the same thing with other people's comments, for example someone will say ""I just visited Sweden"" and I'll say ""I'm learning Swedish"" even thought that's not true. I took a Swedish class about 5 years ago and I'm not actively learning it anymore.

I seem to do this purely for short-term relief of social anxiety. When I'm speaking to people, I'm always a little bit nervous about what to say and whether I'll say things that are interesting or not. This comes from my childhood, which was less than ideal. I was always ignored and constantly put down, so I grew up believing that I was no good. I have since improved hugely (I used to be near agoraphobic and now I have a partner, job, friends and have experienced much more of the world) but I'm still not even close to average level of social ability, so my childhood has left scars. 

Anyway, the basics of it are: I lie when I'm nervous, but not for malicious reasons. I actively dislike that I'm being deceptive and I really want to stop but it feels like a compulsion. I've figured out that the compulsion is born of a desire to eliminate anxiety in the moment, as opposed to a desire to control people or make myself look better for long-term gain. I actually have no objective reason to lie, because my life isn't boring and I don't lie at all (or at least not past the usual level) to family or friends because I feel comfortable talking to them. It's only people that I don't know so well that make me nervous enough to lie. 
I can't find that much information on it online, can anyone give me some advice please?

Edit: Also I should add that this is quite a big problem. I lie pretty much every time I speak to someone I don't know well, and not just on the first instance. I don't know the people at work as well as I know my friends, so I lie every day about various things. I've heard that compulsive lying is usually accompanied by personality disorders or other problems. Is this always the case? If so, how can I go about finding out what related problems I could have?",Stressed

Low and behold, 3 months into this job, and I realize I‚Äôve landed myself in the most horribly toxic work environment I‚Äôve ever been in. People are quitting on the spot and my boss is disclosing their medical history like ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt know he was actually crazy.‚Äù I‚Äôve been so miserable, having nightmares about work so vivid I feel like I never really stop working. I‚Äôm putting in more hours than any other job I‚Äôve had, most days not even getting up from my desk until after 8pm. Several times I told that I was really struggling and unhappy with how things were going and he never said or did anything. It‚Äôs been so bad that I‚Äôve started having thoughts of suicide while I‚Äôm working. So this past Friday, my boss hits me with a 6 page PIP documenting all the times I complained about my role in a private IM to him and painted everything out of context to make me look like a war criminal. I choked my way through the conversation, but immediately after I threw up and then cried almost nonstop for the next 24 hours. I feel completely paralyzed with anxiety and feeling like I‚Äôm a worthless failure. Those passive suicidal thoughts have turned into pretty much nonstop intrusive thoughts. My partner was so worried about me that he took me to urgent care where I just completely broke down. The doctor, on the condition that my partner would keep a close eye on me for the next 24 hours, said I need to get ahold of my psychiatrist first thing tomorrow and take a leave of absence to do an outpatient therapy program. 

The main thing I‚Äôm terrified of, is if it is too late to take a medical leave since I‚Äôve already been put on a PIP? I‚Äôm really afraid of losing my health insurance and not being able to afford seeing a doctor or therapist AND being unemployed :(",Stressed

2400,"Physical Strain from Mental Illness  Physical strain from mental illness

I think insomnia, panic attacks and restlessness (that lasted for around 2 months + I think I experienced burnout symptoms without recognizing them as such for maybe 2-3 years before that) destroyed my body in 2015. I haven't recovered to anything close to normal ever since. 

I haven't experienced an episode like the one in 2015 ever since (knock on wood), but I'm not getting better either. I can't walk for a hundred meters (330ft) without getting tired and almost any form of exercise gives me symptoms of doing too much. Maybe ten situps or going outside for a cigarette don't affect me negatively. 
 
 I don't have the energy or courage to try to tackle this with doctors. I don't trust them to take me seriously. And I'm afraid that if I try/do something too stressful, something like the 2015 episode would repeat itself and make everything ten times worse and lower my chances of recovery even more to the oblivion. 

  And on top of that, I'm dependent on benzodiazepines. Xanax, 2mg a day. I used that as a reason to get out of mandatory military service, as I thought it would be easier than to talk about my physical limitations and now it's on the healthcare database and one nurse that I had last spring even said that she couldn't refer me to psychiatric care because of that dependency.

2401,"Partner mental health issues straining our relationship.  Hi everyone,

I (M/28) just want to share something personal about me. I am not even sure where I stand. Me and my girlfriend (F/27) have been together for 8 years now.

It wasn‚Äôt always easy since she is hard to open up to someone new. I am her first partner.

We have been living together for 5 years now almost.

There was ups and downs in the relationship itself. But since 4 years ago since she graduated Uni everything kind of changed. The relationship went to the extreme, it is either very happy or very sad. She couldn‚Äôt find work for a year and finally good a job that slowed kills her deep inside.  

Last year I nearly died due to sickness and she helped me get back to my feet. She had to balance between her job, me and her mental state which worsen due to additional family problems. a couple of weeks after I manage to survive my sickness and starting recovery, she decided to quit due to work abuse and stress as mentioned before. So I decided to quickly get back to work since we will need the money. And so I did.

Sometime after that she struggled with finding a new job and lost her purpose quickly which leads to a critical depression state with a lot of episodes. I tried my best to support and keep things stable. But I am only a human and of course makes mistakes which leads to her exploding within seconds.

I convinced her to go to therapy, and she finally did. It seemed to be a progress after sometime because the frequency decreases.

The problem is only every time she explodes it is either she left the house and I have to worry where she went and if she is not in danger or I have to leave and wander around the streets while still having to go to the office tomorrow. I suffered also professionally due to this. Lost a lot of self esteem and couldn‚Äôt differentiate if I am in the wrong or she is just not being rational.

It has been almost a year now that I covered all her basic needs and could barely save some money for us.

Today she had her episode again and I am on the streets. I really couldn‚Äôt make it into sense. 

Is this her Metal illness or is it just her? Did I do something wrong or is she just being irrational? For example she demanded that I help with house chores on working hours. Cooking for her during working hours. And I do help with house chores and cook for her. It is just I couldn‚Äôt do it within working hours. She does all this anyway saying that she needs to because she doesn‚Äôt contribute financially. But I never asked her and always try my best to come home early. But she still demand me to do the same. 

I am in a state where I don‚Äôt know what is going on in my life. My best isn‚Äôt my best. I am wrong all the time. I should help when I can, but I also can‚Äôt do it myself.

Sorry for venting out. I cannot explain this to any friends or anyone. Because they don‚Äôt understand and I also have less friends due to the caretaker role.

I do really love and I am committed to help her. But somedays I am just shaken and couldn‚Äôt stand on my feet. And got no one to lean on.

Sorry. Thank you.",Stressed

2403,"Trapped as an Only Child: Overwhelmed by Elderly Parents, Financial Strain, and Isolation. Desperately Seeking Guidance  Life as an only child has had its perks, but now, as a 41 year old woman with two elderly parents, I am finding myself in agony and entering a state of despair. My parents are divorced and live at opposite ends of the continent.   
  
They have been generally healthy, but are entering a stage when health concerns are starting to pop up. My mom's health has recently taken a turn and now her ability to walk (!!) is getting affected. I live in the same city as my dad, so mom is on her own. My mother is estranged from her family, and neither of my parents ever remarried. I am their only close family. I don't have any support system to help me care for my parents. I support my mother financially, even though things are not financially comfortable for me either. I don't even have anyone that can help me think about it, no one to bounce ideas off of.   
  
I don't know what to do and I feel hopelessly alone.  
  
I feel like I haven't been able to start my own life. Even though my mother is across the world, I feel parentified. She calls me multiple times a day to describe how poorly she is feeling. I feel completely powerless.  
  
Honestly, I feel resentful too. I am happy that I am able to support my mother, but I am unable to save any money for myself. I haven't been able to plan for a pregnancy due to financial strain - and now the biological clock is not on my side.  
  
I have been in a relationship with my partner for 12 years, and have been honest with him about my fears that someday something is going to happen with my mom, and I am going to have to drop my life as I know it and travel across the world to help her. While I don't expect him to help her financially or to take care of her, I feel so isolated when not even he is willing to help me think about this. He doesn't even ask what's going on and it feels like we are both living in different realities. He is able to live happily and fairly stress-free, and work on the things he likes, while I have this unbearable weight on my shoulders.   
  
Recently, in a moment of anger, he expressed resentment over my mother and my financial support of her. While I understand this, I wished he would give me at least some kind of support, even if it's just helping me to think about it to come up with some sort of plan. He is so affectionate and wonderful, but I find myself pretending I am happy and chipper just to match my partner's endless happy and goofy natural disposition so I don't kill the mood (again), but I feel like exploding and screaming all day.   
  
My partner works a close to minimum wage job (I am a school nurse, so I make a decent wage) and, while he has many talents, he does not try to get a higher paying job. I have sent him leads and worked on his resume, but he will not make any concrete moves (even though he assures me he wants a better job). I wish he could take a bit of the financial burden from me and kick in a bit extra for bills or help me/us save. He tells me he wants a family, too, but the financial and emotional burden feels like my responsibilities alone to carry. If I have to go spend time with my mom, I won't be able to afford our rent in the States, and neither will he on his own.  
  
I recently expressed to my partner that I am so overwhelmed I am having thoughts of ending it all. I know, this sounds dramatic, but I am at my wits end. I am not going to off myself (I don't have a plan, please don't report me!), but the thoughts of wanting to disappear are chronic. His response was to shut down. Then later, in a moment of anger, he expressed resentment over my financial assistance to my mom. I mean, I feel resentful too, but I don't think it's an option to stop sending her money. I don't want to drop my life here, but I also can't abandon my mom. She has a tiny retirement pension and without my help she won't be able to eat or go to the doctor (her words). I can't afford a caregiver and would not wish a Brazilian nursing home upon my worst enemy.  
  
I am working on a green card for my mom, but the thought of her living with me in a tiny apartment increases my anxiety x100. I love her a lot, but our relationship has been very difficult and traumatic (for me) in many ways. She and I need some comfortable space between us so we don't go crazy.  
  
Again, I have no idea what to do. This is such an isolating experience... I have never felt so alone, and to live with this fear that I am going to have to abandon my life to care for my mother feels like too heavy and an unfair burden to carry.  
  
I'm not even sure if I have a question here - I just need some support and to vent, and to hopefully feel less alone. Thank you for reading this.",Stressed
2404,"i feel like i'm strained and about to fall apart  i get this way sometimes and it feels like i'm terminally ill or something.  like i need rest and get strained by anything.  this morning i was taking my dishes down from my room after breakfast.  i got up too fast, felt faint and weak, lost my grip and dropped everything.  i broke one of my favourite mugs.  i'm just overwhelmed by everything and nothing and now i'm spending the day in bed like an invalid.  

i need so much rest and it's one of life's mercies that i can get it.  i had a psychotic break almost 18 years ago and just haven't functioned in society ever since.  for the 18 years before that, i was pushed constantly, every moment of every day to work and perform and never have time for anything, let alone address abuse and the mounting issues it was causing, hence the following psychotic break.  most days, i can still live my limited life, but now and then, i feel like i'm physically ill.

i'm always trying to improve, but i don't know what the hell i'm doing.  i've been to the dr about my lightheadedness but she seems to think it's not an issue.  to be honest, i think i'm not eating enough sometimes even though i am.  i've lost about 45lbs this year but i've started getting faint this year as well and i think there's a correlation.  that's not to say i'm losing weight without effort or anything.  it's intentional but i'm not starving myself either.  i'm eating around 1700 calories a day but i'm still heavy so my maintenance calories are high so i'm guessing i probably need to eat more.  i might also be overdoing it at the gym.

2407,"Wife [25F] completely drains me [25M]when helping her. Causing stress and strain for me.  Before anyone says we should get a divorce, that is not how I want to go about this. She would likely be driven even further into depression, and maybe even actually commit suicide if we got divorced. She already struggles with suicidal ideation and low self esteem. 

I absolutely love my wife, but she struggles so much with doing even basic household tasks, she can't hold a job, and any time I give either positive or negative reinforcement she just doesn't retain it to drive her to do the next action to make things better. 

She has ADHD, Tourettes (Sp?), Anxiety, Depression, Autism, and an eating disorder called ARFID (Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder). She is on medication for everything and has a therapist and nutritionist, but it just isn't helping her. I don't think she is putting to practice everything that her therapist tells her to do and she sleeps from like, midnight to 1pm or even later most days.

I can't keep up with a full time job, laundry for 2 people, cleaning a 900sqft apartment, our cat and hedgehog, and her constant need for me to be doing something with her and also keep my sanity with only about an hour and a half of being able to do what I want to do each day. I wake up at 6AM every day and on work days I leave for work at 7:30 to be at work at 8. Then I work until 5:30 and get home between 6 and 6:30. Then my wife wants ME to cook dinner, and then we usually either watch something on TV or play Fortnite together.

The problem is, I don't get ANY time except Wednesdays and Sundays to do any amount of cleaning the apartment, because those are my 2 days off. And half of my Wednesdays are taken up by random BS I have to do like doctors appointments or other important tasks. So, I never get a chance to catch up on the laundry littering the bedroom floor and even the living room floor. Or the dishes that pile up, or even basic vacuuming.

All I want her to do at this point is the baby step of basic cleaning, I don't even want her to go a step above and get a job, but she is so fixated on the money aspect of our living situation, which *is* a problem. But the more important problem is the way our apartment looks! We couldn't even realistically have friends over right now, which is something she wants to do, but won't get her butt up to get the apartment clean enough to have people over!

I'm literally at my wits end about how to help her. She wants me to do everything, even help her out of the bath (She is obese, about 290 to 300 lbs) and I just can't keep doing all of this. If anyone has resources or something to help her with her struggles and me with basically being her caretaker at this point, I'm all ears.",Stressed

Finally, this weekend my parents and brothers came to visit me! They were the first guests we have had since moving into our home and I had been looking forward to it so much. However, less than 8 hours into their visit, my mom explodes on my dad and then turned on us. It was so bad she left my house and got a hotel. I spent so much time trying to make the guest room perfect. I wanted to make them proud. After all, this is my first home and my first guests.

Ultimately, I am disappointed and I am finally in the place - at 27 - to consider taking a break from communicating with my mom for a while. I don‚Äôt want to cut her off.

I feel like I can‚Äôt address any really grievances constructively with my mom, and my husband comes across passive and sometimes even frustrated when I try to explain how I feel.

She's told me before that she threatened to kill herself a lot when she was a teenager and she didn't get the same enjoyment out of life and I also know that after having me she had postpartum depression. (Oh and she has a degree in psychology). She understands that repeatedly going on at me about applications and things will make me anxious and stress me out. She knows to not push me to do something when I don't want to. My dad doesn't have that. He'll be completely oblivious to the fact he is causing me to start panicking. He will pester me to do something with him until I give in, not because I want to but to get him to shut up.

I know I'm lucky in the first place to have such caring parents and also that my mum has experienced mental illness so she really understands my needs. I just find it so frustrating that my dad does things that fuck with my mood. That's kinda why I'm crying at the minute. It seems silly but for some reason it's triggered some intrusive thoughts.

2418,"Girlfriend has PTSD, relationship is becoming strained  My girlfriend suffers from moderate to severe PTSD due to her father's suicide by gunshot. She is extremely afraid of guns. I, however, am very interested in guns, I work at a gun shop, I own several firearms, I love the mechanics of them, etc. In every other way we are perfect for each other and we have been trying our best to meet each other halfway.

Her depression is getting worse and so is the PTSD. If I forget to clean under my fingernails after cleaning guns at work, she doesn't want to be touched. Sometimes she doesn't want to be touched by me at all because of my hands (holding guns). She says that in moments of fear she pictures me holding and firing them, doing exactly what killed her father and ruined her family's life. According to her, I am sometimes frightening and she is afraid of me. 

I try my very best to be educated and considerate. I don't mention guns around her or her family as much as possible, there are no guns or anything related around my house and it's all contained in one basement room. I don't really go to the range anymore. Also, I have offered to move my guns to my buddy's house so that she can come over (otherwise she is frantic and anxious there). I would never consider doing any of this for anyone else. I love her so much. But she is suffering because of my interests and hobbies.
She is on medication and attends therapy. Her symptoms have worsened since we began getting more and more serious over the course of our 5 month relationship. She denies it but I think that I'm making her worse. Her flashbacks are apparently pretty bad and they sound really terrifying when she describes them. They even make her suicidal. It kills me to watch her break down in panic attacks knowing that I'm sometimes the ""trigger"". She doesn't want me to give up my interest in firearms and tells me she can get over it but I don't think it's that easy. I can't not be fascinated by them but for the woman I love I would never touch one again if that's what was best. If we have to end it, we will. I only want to find any other alternative.


TLDR; My girlfriend has PTSD and I exacerbate it. We are very much in love and our relationship is wonderful aside from this issue. Should we break up?",Stressed
2419,"My Father's mental state has completely deteriorated and has put a massive strain on the house during quarantine.  My father for a couple years now has gotten into weird religious stuff. It was weird but acceptable before the transplant he got for his kidney in 2017 but ever since the surgery he has gone crazy. He used to be part of cult esq group but has left them and has been on his own for a year now. Ever since quarantine, he has completely lost it. He spends every waking moment on Facebook, staring at abstract images that he believes are messages from Jesus himself. He believes hes an apostle and has been building shrines in and outside the house out of random junk. He hallucinates and see things that aren't there.  He lies to everyone in the family, stealing our stuff for his shrines or taking out large amounts of money buying random things. He has lost 25 pounds in the last two weeks as he says he is too busy for food. He sleeps at random hours, he thinks every word, every color, every sound is a message from god. He refuses to follow quarantine guidelines as he believes he cannot die. He constantly leaves the house, goes to graveyards and churches for a divine quest or something.

He has put a massive strain on the family and my mother has becomes incredibly upset at the thought of getting him mental help. I have no trust for him as I think hes a danger to the house. He lies, he manipulates, and one time he left the burners on the stove on as a show of ""faith"". I can't sleep when hes awake as I don't know what he will do.

2424,"My wife (32) is straining our marriage with anger and irrational outbursts of uncontrolled emotions.  OK, so some background.

We got married a year or so ago. I am living in her country (in asia) and I am having a difficult time with her.

I want to preface this by telling you, 90% of the time, my wife is the most loving, compassionate and forgiving person on the planet.  She is blissful to be around, and is happy, and joyous and pleasurable.  This crazy thing she does, is pretty rare, but it hits so hard, and with increasing frequency, I am worried it will someday lead to an action taken on her part, or mine which could result in a truly un-fixable situation.

Maybe I can break it down into a few stories about her, and maybe I can get some advice on how to pinpoint a way to get some help.  Because we live in Asia, any kind of mental health issue is treated as taboo, and is very difficult to get anyone to get help for, since it basically admits weakness in mind, of of the gravest weaknesses.  (sigh)

1. I knew she had some issues with anger, and control of her temper.  She will randomly fixate on something she thinks happened, and then twist it into a way that I have insulted, or hurt her, even if it's really a mistake or a miscommunication.

example: I work at a radio station as a part-time fun gig. We had a Christmas concert last December.  It was my first, and I was unsure what to expect. But, I was obviously performing, and doing some fun acting etc etc.  My wife and I arrived at the concert, and I had to get prepared. So I made sure she was OK by herself, and went backstage to prepare.

After a while, and a few text messages back and forth, it was time to perform. I went out, did my thing, and afterward, she texted me I was funny, and she was happy to see me etc.  I had some more things to do later in the show, and I wasnt aware how long I would have to wait. so I told her to wait patiently, and I would be on again soon.  We texted several times, and only about 45 minutes had past between texts when I wondered how she was, and texted her that we should be starting soon.  She never replied back, and so I called her, no answer.  I called again, and she picked up. I asked her how she liked the band that was playing.  She told me she was on her way home, and I should go stay somewhere else tonight.  (this was very sudden onset of anger and frustration on her part)

After finishing the concrt, I rushed home, to find she had changed the door code on our new apartment, and left me my cell-phone charger and a note.  dont remember exactly what it was, but it was about staying away etc.

Finally, after about 10 minutes of ringing the doorbell, calling etc she finally answers the phone.  we talk, and it turns out she was upset because I aparantly left her, in a room full of kids, at a concert she now hated for no reason and never took care of her.

Long story kind of short, I managed to talk my way into the house, and finally calm her down with much pleading and apologizing, while trying to maintain that I had no idea she was having a bad time. how could I?

Now, this is not the first thing like this, but its really a clear case where she was fine one minute, and then completely illogical and unable to process information properly.  She does this often at least once a month.

Now, these kinds of outbursts DO happen more frequently around her period, suggesting maybe PMDD or some other hormone imbalance, but I am not sure if that's truly the cause, since she can go off at any time of the month with predictable results.

2. Today, on our second anniversary of our first date, she got upset because aparantly I was distracted (we are in the process of planning a very stressful move to Canada, where I am from) during dinner, and when she asked me to get her some more ketchup, aparantly I wasnt pleasant enough to her, and uttered a ""sure"" or something which about 8 hours later, after thinking about it ad-nauseum I guess she took for me being the rudest person on the planet, and worthy of a divorce. Also she brings up many of the other times she has gone crazy as proof we are the worst couple ever etc etc...  sigh

Now, usually, the outbursts are small enough I can talk her down within an hour or two, but they are leving lasting scars and making me walk on tiptoes around my on house and wife for no reason.

I know there is something I can do for her, and something she can do for herslef, but I want to be prepared to talk to her about it delicately, as I have mentioned, mental health in asia is not something you want to talk about unless it's serious, and debilitating. I dont wish to go into this process with doctors and nurses, checkups and tests without having as much information as I can get.  Unfortunatly, there is little in the way of English-speaking help I can count on here in Asia.

2426,"My mom wants to end her life after years of suffering from chronic pain. We have a strained relationship due to many years of highly manipulative behavior on her part and highly suspected undiagnosed mental illness. She keeps telling me she wants me to be there. What would you do?  Most of it is in the title. We have always had a difficult relationship after I realized as a teen that she was a highly manipulative person with some borderline personality traits. She doesn‚Äôt have many long-term close relationships aside from my dad, sibling, and myself. She has made every significant life event all about her and is generally extremely difficult to get along with. I live overseas in Europe where I have been for the last 8 years, mostly for professional reasons but definitely also partially due to needing space from her in the States. She has been saying for a few months that she wants to end her life with assistance in the Netherlands or else she will just do it herself at home in the States but has told us several times that she wants us all to be there for it. I told her then that I can‚Äôt stop her but I also could never accept that invitation. 

I‚Äôm going home for a few days next week and it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôll see them in person in a year. I know she is going to want to talk about it again but it makes me incredibly uncomfortable and I am really fighting with myself to force myself to even be willing to get on the plane to go. I will never be able to tell her I think it‚Äôs a great idea, but I do respect her right to make that choice, but I think she should stop pushing it on me. She says that she has postponed it because my sibling and I don‚Äôt support it and now seems to blame her continued pain on us. It feels very unreasonable and manipulative that she makes it seem now like it‚Äôs up to us to tell her to do it, otherwise she suffers. I know she is in pain but this is also consistent with her highly manipulative personality traits that were present long before the pain began. To me, it‚Äôs her choice for herself and not mine to make for her. 

As dark as it sounds, I‚Äôd rather get the call that she has done it and is gone, than have to feel like I‚Äôm required to be part of the process. She sent an ominous email to us this week to say we will ‚Äúhave to have some serious conversations‚Äù when I am home. 
I see a lot of online resources for people seeking AS but not really anything for family members or others who might be present at the AS. I‚Äôm really not sure how to handle all of this and my strong ‚Äúflight‚Äù response is kicking in, I want to disappear until it‚Äôs all over but that also makes me feel like a bad person.

2428,"What Are the Top Challenges Facing Medical Healthcare Students Today?  Have you ever wondered what obstacles medical students face in order to pursue careers in medicine? Delving into the world of medicine is undoubtedly a noble pursuit, but it comes with its own unique set of challenges. From the relentless academic pressure to managing the emotional highs and lows of patient care, let's unravel the top issues that make the path to becoming a healthcare professional both rewarding and demanding.  
  
1. Academic Pressure:  
One of the foremost challenges is the intense academic pressure inherent in medical education. The vast volume of information, demanding coursework, and rigorous examinations can create a highly stressful environment. Balancing theoretical knowledge with practical skills adds an extra layer of complexity, often leaving students grappling with time management.  
  
2. Emotional Toll:  
Medical healthcare students frequently encounter emotionally charged situations, dealing with illness, suffering, and sometimes loss. The emotional toll of witnessing these aspects of human life can be overwhelming. Coping mechanisms and emotional resilience become crucial skills to develop, as maintaining empathy while preserving one's mental health is a delicate balance.  
  
3. Financial Strain:  
The cost of medical education, including tuition, books, and living expenses, can be exorbitant. Many students face the challenge of managing substantial student loans and financial strain, impacting their focus on studies and potentially contributing to burnout. Exploring financial assistance options and budgeting becomes essential for alleviating this burden.  
  
4. Work-Life Balance:  
Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is a perpetual struggle for medical healthcare students. The demanding nature of their studies and clinical rotations often leaves little time for personal lives, leading to exhaustion and potential burnout. Finding strategies to prioritize self-care and personal time becomes crucial for sustaining long-term success in the medical field.  
  
5. Competitive Residency Placements:  
Securing a desirable residency placement is a significant concern for medical students. The competition is fierce, and the process can be stressful. Students often grapple with the pressure to excel academically, gain relevant experience, and showcase their unique qualities to stand out in the highly competitive selection process.  
  
In summary, a medical healthcare student's path is characterized by obstacles that go beyond the classroom. Addressing these issues requires a combination of resilience, support systems, and strategic planning to foster success and well-being in the pursuit of a medical career.

2429,"My best friend is depressed but won't admit it and it is a huge strain on me and our relationship  My friend has had a serious episode of depression, and I am certain it has returned and that she has been depressed for a while now. I have been surrounded by depression a lot in my life (although I am fortunate enough never to have had it myself) and have read a lot on the subject. 

She says she can't stop crying ""for no good reason"", is very pessimistic, it doesn't take anything to put her in a bad mood/make her cry anymore, she's easily agitated and irritable and feels excluded and alone and is generally very ""down"" most of the time. 

I am a super empathetic person and it always affects me terribly when she is very down, and especially when I can't do anything to procure a smile on her face. I am the only one close enough to her to notice what's going on and therefore, to do anything about it and the sense of responsibility is killing me. I know I have way too high expectations of myself when it comes to this, and I am working on it. I am trying to sort of mentally distance her unhappiness from my happiness, but it's hard. I just feel so drained.

The worst thing about this is that she won't admit that anything's wrong. A typical answer I get from her is that she's just going through a ""neutral"" time, but I call BS on that. I believe that she won't admit it because of how scary it is face the reality of her having to deal with this once again, and when she's so young. She refuses to go talk to a professional - not even to clear up IF there is a problem. I have tried so much, but nothing's getting through to her. 

I am very worried and upset because we can almost never be together anymore and just enjoy ourselves. Being her friend is very hard at the moment, but I don't want to lose hope. 

It would be much appreciated if anyone has advice on how to go about being her friend and what to do to make her want to seek help herself. I have read about this, but hopefully someone with experience/an expert could give me a few words of advice.

2431,"I feel like I‚Äôm not allowed to improve my mental health  TW: OCD talk (brief non-specific mention of obsessions/compulsions), mentions of illness anxiety, pandemic talk

This might be something better to post in the OCD subreddit but I figured what I‚Äôm experiencing is something that people with a variety of mental health issues could relate to

For some background: shortly after the pandemic started, I was diagnosed with OCD. I had been struggling with illness anxiety for probably over a year at that point, but the pandemic triggered compulsions for me that severely impeded my life and continue to do so. It was basically my absolute worst nightmare come true

I‚Äôd been in therapy for 3-4 years already by then, but mostly for anxiety/depression/etc

Long story short, the last 4 years have been an absolute hell for my mental health, I became borderline agoraphobic, have had multiple OCD episodes, and it‚Äôs put a lot of strain on my relationships with my family, as I‚Äôm somewhat socially isolated (I‚Äôve struggled to make friends for a long time and have one friend who is my closest confidante and best friend)

I carry a lot of guilt for the way my mental illness has manifested in my behaviors, and the meltdowns I‚Äôve had because of it. There‚Äôs also a lot of family/childhood trauma mixed up in it, but the bottom line is I‚Äôve reached a point where I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve to get better.

Part of it stems from fear that if I have things in my life that make me happy, I‚Äôll inevitably lose them for whatever reasons. 

But another part of it is definitely rooted in shame. I‚Äôve suffered a lot, but I‚Äôve also been a huge burden to my family because of how enduring and toxic this illness is. I do my best to not enforce my compulsions on them, but it was really bad during the pandemic bc none of them cared or were as worried as I was. 

I feel like I‚Äôve been too bad and now if I were to get better, if I were to feel HAPPY or at the very least shed some of the constant fear I live in every day, then everyone would resent me for having been so unwell for so long. I go to therapy twice a week  
and am actively trying to work on myself always, but I can‚Äôt shake this. 

TL;DR: After a continuing struggle with OCD since diagnosis, and some already strained relationships being further strained by how my illness comes in episodes, I feel like if I were to get better, then everyone would resent me for having been unwell ‚Äúfor nothing‚Äù, and so I don‚Äôt deserve to get better or be happy or be unafraid.

2446,"My spouse has had cannabis-induced psychosis but had a sober episode last night.  Just as the title says, my (35F) spouse (40M) has gone into psychosis after smoking weed (a few times). 

His last episode was sometime last summer. He was having a really hard time sleeping, so he used my vape pen that had a CBD dominant strain in it. I do shift work and this particular strain helps me get to sleep easily. Foolishly, we both thought that because the strain was CBD dominant, he wouldn't be affected. Boy were we wrong. 

His heart starts racing, he breaths deeply and closes his eyes as though he's trying not to lose control. He always asks me to get close to him because he's scared. I know immediately that when this happens, he's about to ""go into the hole"" as he calls it. These are his prodromal symptoms so-to-speak.

His hands and fingers start to move uncontrollably, he'll grab onto whatever is close by with super human strength and then starts yelling absolute nonsense...like word-salad. And there's no trying to talk him down. He's completely disconnected from reality.

He has this absent look in his eyes and it's terrifying. 
Every time this has happened, he's been in bed and hasn't gotten up.. It's like he's stuck in whatever position he's in.

Needless to say, he hasn't touched any cannabis products since. These cannabis-induced episodes last about 40-45 minutes.

What I'm concerned about is that last night, he woke me up around 1am with those prodromal symptoms. I shot out of bed, put on my housecoat and went downstairs, ready to get in the car, drive away and call 911.
He didn't have a full blown episode... Just those prodromal symptoms. I went back upstairs after about 10 minutes and he was almost back to his normal self.

He had no alcohol, cannabis or anything preceding this event. He remembered everything.

 I'm worried that he has an underlying psychotic disorder. Any ideas what he might be dealing with?",Stressed

2452,"Insight #1: Good Timber - We Humans are Antifragile  # Good Timber by Douglas Malloch

The tree that never had to fight

For sun and sky and air and light,

But stood out in the open plain

And always got its share of rain,

Never became a forest king

But lived and died a scrubby thing.

The man who never had to toil

To gain and farm his patch of soil,

Who never had to win his share

Of sun and sky and light and air,

Never became a manly man

But lived and died as he began.

Good timber does not grow with ease:

The stronger wind, the stronger trees;

The further sky, the greater length;

The more the storm, the more the strength.

By sun and cold, by rain and snow,

In trees and men good timbers grow.

Where thickest lies the forest growth,

We find the patriarchs of both.

And they hold counsel with the stars

Whose broken branches show the scars

Of many winds and much of strife.

This is the common law of life.

----------------------------

If a tree does not encounter enough wind as it grows, it will eventually collapse under its own weight. Its roots simply won‚Äôt grow deep enough to maintain structural integrity as it ages.

Trees fight for the light they get in the forest. They also have to be strategic in their pursuit. If they maximize their branch growth too early, they experience arrested height growth, and fail to reach the canopy above. This often happens if the tree experiences too much light too early in its grown trajectory. The tree becomes content with what light it already gets, and so it stops reaching upward. It gives up on the struggle, and spreads it branches at its earliest convenience. It‚Äôs early good fortune robs it of its ability to fulfill its potential. It mistakenly assumes its current position is its peak. It fails to realize, brighter days await it, if it only continues to fight upwards towards the sky.

Those trees that ultimately peak above the canopy, and obtain the greatest light exposure, are the ones strategic enough to refuse complacency at its earliest beckoning. Often times, its able to do this, because it was never given an over abundance of light during its stressful journey upwards. Some light along the path is necessary, but too much light, given too early, can seduce the tree into abandoning its struggle to the top. The forest kings needs to experience sufficient darkness. They need to be made to fight for the light. Stopping can‚Äôt be an options. For if it were to do so, it would mean death. All the way up, is the only viable path. Straight through the darkness is the only way out.

Here I‚Äôll be explain the Core Concept that We Humans Are Antifragile. I‚Äôll break this into four parts. First, I‚Äôll introduce the property of antifragility. Second, I‚Äôll explain how antifragile systems need to be challenged during development. Third, I‚Äôll cover how easy success can result in a weak foundation. And fourth, I will address how good fortune and easy times can cause the systems regression and undoing.

# We Humans are Antifragile.

**1. Antifragility is the property of a system in which it requires stress, pressure, failure, and adversity, in order for it to actualize its capacities and capabilities.**

* Bones are antifragile. If they don‚Äôt undergo enough stress during their development, they‚Äôll remain weak and brittle. They‚Äôll break easily.
* As I just described, many species of tree are anti-fragile, and require the strain of wind to develop the strength to bear their own weight. The more storms a tree survived during its growth, the deeper its roots.
* Some trees require stifled light exposure in order for them to breach the canopy above.
* Civilization is antifragile. It requires repetitive failures and mistakes, in order for it to learn the wisest laws and develop the infrastructure to support its growth. It requires attacks upon it, and hardship, such that it learns to defend itself, repair itself, and satisfy its own demands. For the civilization to learn, failure and hardship is required.

These are each examples of antifragility. And we humans follow this same principle.

**2. Antifragile systems need to be challenged during development.**

* This is why helicopter parenting and being overly protective of your child can be so damaging to the child‚Äôs maturation.
* If a child isn‚Äôt allowed to limit test reality and themselves, they have no chance of becoming formidable adults. They‚Äôll remain spineless, skidding, unable to bravely confront the challenges of adulthood.
* They‚Äôll remain naive, lacking the direct experience of life‚Äôs dangers. They won‚Äôt have the understand of how to skillfully handle themselves when faced with genuine threats.
* The children that grow to be the most cunning and capable of handling themselves, are the ones that were allowed to roam the world with minimal oversight. They were allowed to learn from direct experience.
* This phenomenon is commonly delineated as having street-smarts, opposed to book smarts. Knowledge isn‚Äôt sufficient. Direct experience is mandatory.
* Facing real threats, real adversity, real suffering, and overcoming it on one‚Äôs own. This is a necessary prerequisite to a fully developed individual

**3. How easy success can result in a weak foundation.**

* It‚Äôs often the case in many domains, those who are most naturally talented become stunted in their growth once they reach the point at which they must strain for improvement.
* In his book Zen Mind, Beginner‚Äôs Mind, the Zen mast Shunryu Suzuki explains how in calligraphy, its usually the students that are most naturally skillful that ultimately hit a mental wall they can‚Äôt surpass. This is because their hands were too cleaver from the beginning. They never had to learn the practice deeply, the success came too easily for them. They didn‚Äôt have to work for it. Once they reach the point at which they had to strain, they become discouraged. They couldn‚Äôt account for what allowed them to learn before, and not now. They had never learned the skill of overcoming struggle. They didn‚Äôt understand the level of hard work necessary for the full actualization of their potential. They then often quit.
* Where as those students that were bad from the beginning. Struggle was all they knew. And so at no point, do they hit a wall that they aren‚Äôt willing to patiently face and overcome. They already understood what greatness would cost them. And they had already decided long ago that they were willing to pay it. But the ones that learned too quick, never realized what they were in for. The force with which that sudden realization hits them, cause them to break.
* Gifted children who aren‚Äôt sufficiently challenged in education can follow this same trajectory towards failure. Often floundering and falling apart in higher level course work that actually requires them to put their nose to the grindstone and fight for their grades. They never developed the skill of rigorous study, as they‚Äôd never had to do it prior. This sudden and unfamiliar strain can cause them to fall apart when the stakes are the highest.
* When success comes to easily, the growth is porous and fragile. The bone that grows in low gravity grows easily, but lacks the density. The student that effortlessly passes through school never really develops deep learning. They might climb high, but until they dig deep, they will lack true mastery of the subjects. It‚Äôs like a tower built on toothpicks.

**4. How good fortune and easy times can cause the systems regression and undoing.**

* As discussed earlier, some trees will stop their upward growth prematurely, if they are lucky enough to hit a overly substantial patch of sun-rays while being far below the canopy. Luck would have it that they were positioned just right upon sprouting from the ground, that an abundance of light was available to them amid the low branches of greater trees. They‚Äôre content to remain nestled there, far below their ultimate potential.
* This similar dynamic plays out with humans. Often times, when people reach a sufficiently comfortable life, they ease off. The desire for self-growth diminishes. They nestle in. They soften. And if catastrophe strikes, and more is required of them than usual, they crumble. As they never developed themselves beyond what was necessary to sustain their current altitude.
* Even entire societies face this dilemma. We‚Äôre all familiar with the notion that Hard times make for great men. Great men make for easy times. Easy times make for weak men. Weak men make for hard times. And the cycle repeats. When we‚Äôre no longer fighting upwards, we begin to lose the skill of fighting. And in time, we will begin move backwards. We will regress.
* When an individual wins the lottery, it can often times be the worst thing that ever happened to them. That‚Äôs because, an undeveloped person winning the lottery, is like a deep sea fishes being pulled up to sea-level. Many deep-sea fishes require tons of external pressure to maintain their bodies form and structural integrity. Without that pressure, they literally implode and die. That‚Äôs how humans work. If a person hasn‚Äôt developed themselves, and formed the skill of self-imposed strain and adversity, they will be destroyed when all external pressure is removed from your life.
* Because the truth is, humans atrophy from a lack of challenge and hard work. Unless we are pushing our limits, we are moving backwards.
* Humans operate like bicycles. When in motion, remaining upright is relatively easy. When at a stand still, toppling over is just a matter of time.



There‚Äôs a far deeper truth at play here, but the time to address that will come in the future. For now, simply seek to understand that stress, suffering, and failure are necessary feature of a healthy lifestyle. They are mandatory prerequisite for a deeply fulfilling existence lived by a self-actualizing individual. Without continually confronting them, you will erode. The goal isn‚Äôt to eradicate them. But to instead, skillfully walk beside them. Journey amid the shadows, both arms extended, with your fingers running along the cusp of darkness. The only way out, is through.",Stressed

2454,"How to Seek Forgiveness?  Hello r/mentalhealth,

I'm at a bit of a loss. My family and I have been going through some very hard times. I got news over the last few years that COVID had accelerated the degradation of my mental health. To make matters worse, I am showing signs of uncontrollable swelling on the brain and cardiovascular trauma.

What this translates into is me having regular bouts of ""checking out"" and going into bursts of anger, bitterness, and hysterical paranoia. I don't physically hurt anyone, but the things I say are extremely hurtful and mostly misplaced, due to my mind confusing past traumas with the current realities. I sadly lose the ability to process short term memory, and during these times of ""autopiloting"" I fail to remember anything until after my body goes into a full melt down and blacking out.

Those in my family are caught with the trauma of me going through it, often hurting those I love, and leaving them with no ability to seek comfort and the important aftercare needed to cope with my episodes. I apologize profusely, and despite my best efforts I can't simply ""avoid the triggers"" because sometimes those triggers I can cope with, and sometimes I can't. Many of the triggers are simply a part of life, and things I can't simply avoid.

How do you all cope with these things? How can one seek forgiveness knowing that the episodes, despite therapy and medication, will continue to happen, and if anything... get worse?

I love my family and friends, and it pains me seeing them hurt while also finding themselves defensive and walking on eggshells around me. Having no memory of the reasons why, but seeing the side effects make this increasingly more difficult, as I don't really have any way of making it easier. As my body continues to strain through what I can only guess is Long COVID, my brain swelling, regular episodes of syncope, as well as regular failure to process memory this has continued to be an overwhelming strain on the relationships with those I hold dear.

I'm lost, desperate, and no amount of paid and spiritual guidance has been able to find a solution. If it is just a ""fact of life"" going forward, I can try my best to accept it and just do what I can to overcompensate. It is just a painful thing to go through, let alone seeing those I care about go through the burden of helping me through it as well.",Stressed

2465,"Getting Enough Fat  Getting Enough Fat

My aunt is a dietitian who specializes in eating disorders, which are almost always associated with depression and other mental health issues. I personally have a healthy relationship with food, but she has made clear the importance of getting enough fat in the diet as someone struggling with mental health.

The premise is that, in order for our neurons to fire efficiently and properly, they must have well maintained myelin, a fatty substance which wraps around the neurons, acting like insulation. Think of it like the plastic around your phone charger. If we aren‚Äôt getting enough fat in the diet (through whatever source) it doesn‚Äôt allow for proper repair and function of myelin, causing the brain to work harder to meet the same goals. This added strain can lead to symptoms of depression such as chronic fatigue. 

Help yourself out next time you sit down for a meal and ask yourself if there‚Äôs enough fat or oil.

I don‚Äôt know why but I started to see the hidden aura of every person, of my every friend. For instance, my friend said one minor thing, which I started to analyze and find the sense. Sometimes, I felt negative but others didn‚Äôt. I can feel the true intention of a person (I think so, but other people tell me that it‚Äôs wrong). But I don‚Äôt know, it seems like somebody has a strong charisma and impact, and can comport himself like an innocent person. 
Also, besides this, when I‚Äôm contacting with girls (it isn‚Äôt hard for me but they are not interested in me, BUT I THINK THAT I‚ÄôM A GOOD BOYFRIEND; I mean that I never drank, I never smoked, I always do sports like mixed martial arts, roller skating, and powerlifting, and I always care about others interests), I feel ashamed that I can strain her and so on, and because of this I can‚Äôt communicate with them normally. I see every detail in every conversation. I don‚Äôt know how to remove this quality and don‚Äôt be so vulnerable emotionally

I can smoke a diff strain and have a good time.

ps. i think his cause of developing it may be because he experienced war in Afghanistan in early 2000s which i know is very traumatizing, but mr myself i cant really say i‚Äôve been in a super very traumatizing event.

2473,"Desperate for Direction  Hi all, I'll share a bit of my story in hopes someone might be able to point me in the right direction.
 
I had a stress related burnout in 2017, which left me with fog brain and lethargy for about a year, I started taking good care of my heath with diet and exercise and my energy returned, I was motivated and went flat out at work. I had a poor sleep one night and still went flat out the next day, by the afternoon something didn't feel right, I crashed and burned out badly with my head, its like I had completely fried my brain.
 
What resulted was a very limited capacity mentally, I would read a couple of pages, feel my brain straining, read another paragraph and my brain would ""fry"", which was a very tangible strain in my head. It would be often completely debilitating. I struggled with this for a long time, sometimes it would be better sometimes it would return for several months, sometimes caused just by having a cup of coffee but then it would stick around for months.
 
In October 2019 I burned out and this is where my chronic fatigue started. I had a string of ""burnouts"" and would eventually start recovering, only to go flat out again, or be forced into doing too much ie. at work. The more this happened the harder it would be to start recovering. I was very much in a survival mode, just trying to get through the day, for several years. 
 
A bit over a year ago, a cup of coffee caused my head to significantly to ""fry"", it hasn't recovered since. My brain can't handle much of anything, I won't get through a movie without frying my brain, I can rarely read much, or do anything slightly mentally taxing. I have been incapable of working, and now I'm starting to get more desperate as money is running out.
 
I've seen several doctors (GP) and a naturopath and it's like no body has any clue whats going on with my head. I've got quite severe chronic fatigue, I've tried all kinds of supplements to no avail. I can live with the chronic fatigue but having no mental capacity is wearing me down. Sometimes it has felt like it's started to recover, only to go back to square one because I read a little too much or watched YouTube.

It's so hard to explain what I'm feeling but it's like my brain is strained/sprained, often not going away till I wake up the next morning. I'm struggling to finish writing this, I won't have the capacity to check what I've written so hopefully I make some sense.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",Stressed

When I did any kind of physical exercise after 5 to 6 hours I would experience blurred recent memory, difficulty recalling thoughts, excessive stress, trouble speaking, a feeling like I didn't know who I was and where I was and most importantly I couldn't  sleep after 2 weeks of frequent physical exercises.  It started suddenly when I was 13-14, while I was always a hyperactive type.  This lasts for 3 days after physical activity (as long as the muscle heals) but the more you train in a row, the worse it gets.  I dealt with this problem as follows: I ate immediately before and after the gym (resistance, not cardio), after the gym I took a cold shower focusing on the muscles I strained and back on the neck* (after the gym I noticed that the head is very hot).  Creatine and caffeine also help to be in a caloric surplus.  I went to the gym only when my thinking was clear (after 3-4 days and this time was decreasing).  After 3 months of gym, my thinking had stopped being clouded and I could stop the whole mundane process.  The main idea is that the carbohydrate needed for the brain to function goes to the muscles, then something goes wrong and it starts to malfunction. ",Stressed

So I came to Florida to visit my aunt because she had a tumor in her stomach and my mom and my cousin wanted to be there for her through her operation. After the operation was over and the tumor wasn't cancerous we were all overwhelmed with joy and decided to visit some places and have a little fun before we leave Florida. Last Sunday we went to the Fort George Inlet and River to enjoy and ride on Jetskis. Had a lot of fun but towards the end of the day I accidentally fell in the water and lost my glasses, and I practically wear my glasses everyday so that made me a little sad. Several days later I started getting tension headaches and normal headaches, feeling nauseous, and just not feeling right, and today I feel like I'm getting a cold or I'm going to have one. I started to get worried and still am worried that it might not just be symptoms of eye strain but something bigger like an ameoba inside my brain or something, and since that day I got my headache i haven't been able to stop this consistent worry that it might be something really bad. I'm hoping that it's just eye strain and the neck pain I have is also because of the eye strain but I don't even know anymore. I'm also losing my train of thought very easily than before that day which is also freaking me out. It's been literally a whole week since we went on that trip and still am paranoid.

1. Going inpatient is bold, and awesome, and good on you! But, it's only a start. You don't ""cure"" grief, depression, anxiety, or psychotic illnesses by going inpatient. Mental illness takes YEARS to cope with, and a slew of treatment providers.
2. Inpatient treatment sucks. It's not a resort. It's hard and it hurts, like effective therapy. Change is hard. It's not the program, it's you. Sorry, not sorry, that you thought self-reflection and change would be easy.
3. All inpatient does is delay and, hopefully, poise you to make the important changes you will need to make to make your life liveable.
4. Most people working inpatient don't make shit... Contrary to popular option, it's incredibly stressful, and physically painful, to work in psych, for much less than one would make working any other field.

Shitting on your inpatient experience only increases the hesitancy of potential workers, states them, and otherwise turns people away from helping. To then ask,""Why doesn't someone help?!""... 

Well, because the job pays shit, I have to work the worst hours, I literally get punched in the face working... Then some random online shit on me for showing up to work...

They are basically an invalid, have schizoaffective disorder, and are unable to work or even socialise much of the time. They would be considered the disorganised subtype of schizophrenia back when that was a thing, so basically to an outside perspective they talk incoherently constantly (sometimes quite vulgar things) and behave and do very strange things that are very unnerving.

During their worst psychotic episodes or if they don't take meds, they can become violent or suicidal. But they were released from involuntary commitment after ten days once being put on more meds, yet the issue remains that they can't take care of themselves and it's putting a strain on everyone as we all have problems we are trying to deal with. He has a substance abuse problem as well, which compounds the issue.

I know that we can't help him and if he's to ever have a shot at a normal life, he needs a multi-faceted approach that doesn't just include giving medication to placate him. He needs to be able to socialise with others, needs to get on a consistent treatment that helps, needs to get off of recreational drugs--none of this is possible while he stays here.

The problem is the mental health facilities here seem to require that they're a danger to themselves or others. Are we just supposed to wait until he assaults someone enough times until they will agree to long-term commitment? I don't understand...

2517,"Seeking Advice: How to Support My Husband Through a Psychosis Episode   Dear Reddit community,

I'm turning to you all in a time of need, as my husband is currently going through a challenging psychosis episode, and I'm struggling to navigate it effectively. The situation is complex and emotionally taxing, and I could really use some specific guidance on how to be there for him while also taking care of myself.

Here's the situation: My husband is experiencing vivid delusions that are causing him significant distress. He firmly believes that I'm talking to one of his cousins (he had his ex cheat on him with, so sure there‚Äôs some PTSD somewhere in there), hears derogatory voices directed at him, and is convinced that people can hear his thoughts. Despite my attempts to reassure him and provide evidence to the contrary, he remains steadfast in these beliefs.

One of the most challenging aspects of this situation is how it's affecting our relationship. He's become increasingly suspicious of me, convinced that I'm cheating on him. His distrust is palpable, and it's causing strain in our marriage. I find myself constantly walking on eggshells, unsure of how to respond to his accusations without escalating the situation further.

Furthermore, my husband's obsession with these delusions is consuming all of his time and energy. He's constantly recording everything, convinced that he can hear the voices in the recordings, even though I don't hear anything. It's heartbreaking to see him so consumed by these thoughts, and I'm worried about the toll it's taking on his mental health.

As much as I want to support him through this, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to do so without getting offended or upset. How can I be there for him in a way that's supportive and understanding while also setting boundaries to protect my own well-being? I want to maintain a sense of compassion and empathy, but it's challenging when he's treating me as if I'm betraying him.

Additionally, I'm concerned about his safety. I fear that if these delusions persist, he may end up hurting himself in some way. Google has only deepened this fear. How can I ensure that he stays safe and gets the help he needs without imposing my own agenda or making him feel invalidated?

I'm open to any and all advice, insights, or personal experiences that you may have to offer. Thank you in advance for your support and understanding during this difficult time.

2530,"Am I a horrible person for crying over my grandma leaving?  My grandma lived with us from when I was around 7 to when I was 11. When she moved away it was very hard on me and I missed her everyday and it caused us to have a strained relationship for a while.  
We are all good now but then today something changed. I live in another country than the rest of my family, am 23, single, barely any friends and no kids. My grandma is staying at my childhood home to recover after a surgery. Today she left very early in the morning, before I woke up. As far as I knew she was supposed to go back home with my parents to take care of some things and return the same day, but now I was told she will be staying home until she needs to come back to have her stitches taken out (possibly). When I learned that I burst into tears (no one saw me). I feel like I am 11 years old, staring at her empty bedroom again. She uses a special kind of toilet seat because of the surgery and when I saw it was gone I burst into tears again. I cannot stop crying which is stupid, I know, I am 23 fucking years old, and it's not like I was just hanging around her all day.  
My parents don't know I'm this upset about her leaving and I will likely not tell them. Or anyone else

2534,"Need some support related to ODD as an adult  A preface, I was formally diagnosed with autism when I was a child, and there were suspicions about ODD up until my preteens until it was formally considered. 

If I didn't want to do something, I wouldn't. I would rather fail a class, lose a friend or something else drastic than do a piece of work that I didn't want to do, or thought was a waste of my time. Had I done it before? Not doing it. Did I think I was too smart to do it? Nope, still not doing it. Bribery? Didn't work. Was told all of the things like 'you have to work with people that you don't agree with' and didn't agree with that, or 'sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do' which made me do the opposite of what they wanted.

I'm an adult now, and it's bled into my adulthood pretty negatively. My defiance depends on the day, and I can at-random change plans and decide that I don't want to do something... because I just don't want to, and it's straining friendships. I have a friend that will ask to do something, I say okay, and then the next day I say no and he gets upset at me for changing plans... but forcing myself to go out and do something when I explicitly do not want to (for whatever reason) is like pulling teeth. I'm grumpy, irritable and can lash out very easily. On top of that, I have a hard time of saying 'no' to my friends.. so I go through the cycle of agreeing and then going back on it randomly. Just need some support and help related to that, because it's really impacting my mental health and exhausting my social battery.

2535,"Obsession and anxiety with money  I grew up with a privileged life, in an upper middle class neighborhood.  Parents always supported me, and gave me opportunities most people my age would never experience.

I went off to college in a beach town, went to work, and enjoyed a simple life of surfing and working out.  Money was never a huge issue for me because I spent under my means.  

6 years ago, I moved to Silicon Valley to join the tech rush, and am absolutely obsessed with money - looking for that next big paycheck or that huge successful stock pick.  It's placing a strain on my relationship with my partner because I think it's never enough.  

I think part of it was driven by the tech rat race, but also wanting to be able to provide opportunities for my family just as I was provided when I was a kid.  All I think about now is income, expenses, and how much money we need to have for future events, and how to get there.

I have a $200k/yr job, $400k in a 401k, and $200k in a brokerage account at 33 yrs old and I feel like I'm behind others.  People say I'm way ahead of the game, but I don't feel that way.

I've been struggling lately - I am dealing with a few health issues that keep me in the high risk group with Covid and it has really put a strain on familial relations - both in my house and outside of just our household.  

I have tried to book appointments with therapists but they are so busy it is months before I could see anyone.  There is a psychiatrist that was recommended to me but that feels a little intimidating.  I'm certainly willing to consider medication, but I am pretty hesitant since I take a lot of stuff already for the other conditions and I don't want a lot of side effects.  

The psychiatrist offers both medication and therapy appointments, and it feels like someone has to be better than no-one at this point - I am hurting, which is daunting to admit.

2548,"I feel like I'm terrible son to my mom all because of my mental health the last 4 years.  My mom and I (24m) have always had a very good and strong relationship. However that all changed in 2019 right before covid started. And because of it I feel like a disgrace of a child to her, when all she does is try her best and love me unconditionally.

To start off, I never had any mental health problems growing up. I was bullied and picked on pretty bad for about 10 years all through elementary and part of high school but that quickly stopped when I started doing sports in high school. My older brother (28m) was pretty abusive to me growing up. I didn't feel like I had much of a brother until he turned about 19-20 and, until recently has really started trying to be a better brother to me, evening letting me come along with him and his gf to France back in May. Whether I had any sort of depression or anxiety as a kid it never surfaced until I was about 19. I was at my dad's and stepmom's place for the week. She has always been into murder/true crime shows. She was watching this one show and the episode was about how this guy's girlfriend convinced him to kill his mom. This resulted in me having incredibly violent and intrusive thoughts towards my mom daily to the point I had to isolate myself from her for almost a month in order to protect her from myself. I told her what I was dealing with and she was very supportive and knew I would never do anything to harm her. I started going to therapy and getting put on different kinds of antidepressants over the last few years. However these thoughts went on for what was probably close to 1.5-2 years or so, whether we were in the same room or not. The intrusive thoughts had caused me to develop severe generalized anxiety, depression and some OCD tendencies because I was so fixated on trying to prevent these thoughts. I have broken down numerous times at work because I either get too anxious and depressed, or cry myself to sleep because it's the only way to relieve some of what I feel sometimes. There's almost this feeling with my mom like she annoys me, even with small talk and asking how my day was, simply because of this trauma from my past I can't seem to break away from and now things are so awkward and no matter how much I've talked about it at therapy, and the skills they've given me, nothing seems to be helping. I feel like an absolutely terrible son all because of something that was out of my control, that I saw on tv, which triggered a rewiring in my brain causing me to be on edge for weeks. All she does is her best and love me unconditionally and I can't stand the way our relationship is now. I'm so heart broken, and even after talking about it before with her, nothing seems to even change because my brain has just gotten so used to this. Please can anybody from personal experience give me any sort of help or advice on how to fix this strained relationship?

TLDR, I started having intrusive thoughts about my mom after my step mom watched this crime show while I was in the room. Relationship with mom is now strained to the point I feel like it's beyond repair and it absolutely breaks me because she still tries her best to fix our relationship and I can't seem to fix my end of it.",Stressed

I've been with my partner for over 10 years; we got married over a year ago now.

During our relationship, intimacy has always been an issue almost like they have no libido at all or arrousal / urges. This has obviously taken a toll on me over the years, and I was led to believe it would change with marriage and it has not.

It's now been over a year and we've not even consumated the marriage, I feel totally lost and worthless and have no idea what to do anymore. They're not a bad person, I'm sure of that but all I get are constant excuses.

A few years ago they were diganosed with vaginismus and some therapy was done, but nothing changed and still couldn't have intercourse as it would be too painful. There isn't even any other activity at all, they've never had intercourse with anyone.

I'm now at the point where I've begun to think of other options, even to the point of looking at assisted suicide, the mental strain this has put on me and my self worth has reduced me to not knowing who I am anymore or what is right.

I've set some personal lines in my head, which have passed multiple times to end this relationship, but I've now set my final one for the end of year, but she does not know this. I've said we have to solve the situation or I can't continue but not sure that has sank in.",Stressed

They would tell me to *move on* or to *get a glow up* but honestly I'm just too tired for anything. I too, would love to improve myself. I tried, but I realized how hard it actually was. I'm too tired. I can't deal with anything under the amount of mental strain I have. High school is shit too, I'm also not academically gifted nor do I try to. I desire to have good academics but its so hard. *Why is life so hard?* I'm tired of everything in my goddamn life. Being born a human being has to be a punishment created by the universe. What's the point of even existing when happy things are only temporary through hardships? It's my second day of school and the straining has never been worse. Multiple deadlines are now due and yet here I am wasting my time again on several social media platforms. I have a major piano competition/test upcoming, I've never realized how close it was until it was too late. My parents have been very expectant of my choice of colleges too. They want better results out of me, but I simply just...can't. It's dumb to say I've tried to make my grades better because I've definitely didn't. I never bothered to try, not because I don't want to, but simply because I was just too tired for anything. Tired for what though? I don't even know what tires me anymore. I absolutely cannot blame my parents for this. I know they love me very much. Its worth to note that my birthday was recently too (August 30th) and I was torn to shit. I've still gotten zero answers about my relationship with my girlfriend, but this was the first time she's never celebrated a special day with me. I was absolutely torn, but my parents, they were there for me; they care for me, they hugged me that day and bought me a cake. It was the happiest I've been in a while. I need rest, but it's not something hours of sleep can even cure. I wake up everyday both physically and mentally tired. I hate my body, I'm scrawny and small for my muscles. Honestly, I don't even know how I got a girlfriend...maybe I was used. My now-ex is currently in the same class as I am. We chose to have multple classes together when we were dating, but now I can't even concentrate. It's hard to avoid her, her figure, her voice, her literal presence just makes me want to cry.  I miss her but she doesn't. I've been through too much, I believe no one deserves the amount of shit I've been through. Everything is crushing me. Why does life has to be so hard? I want to kill myself. I don't want to live anymore, but I'm afraid of dying. Fuck being a human. I wish I was a cat.",Relaxed

2562,"should I tell my dad I'm relapsing? (ED)  TL;DR : I have had an eating disorder but I'm relapsing after a noticeable weight gain during recovery. Family doesn't know I have an ed (dad once noticed weight loss but I brushed it off; mum freaks out if I try to approach the matter). Should I tell my dad I'm not fine or do I simply get my shit together? 

&#x200B;

Long Read: 

I have (had?) an eating disorder.   
Haven't told anyone apart from my best friend (whom I told after recovering). It was a coping mechanism, and when I moved and found myself in a brand new place I started to recover alone by working out with bodyweight and dumbells, not skipping meals, and focusing on macro nutrients rather than calories. There have been high and lows, but I managed to get back to my usual weight.   
Now I gained what I think is a shit ton of weight considering my very short height>! (gained 11 pounds. I'm 5'0 ""tall"" and 20F)!< in a very short amount of time (1 month and a half) when I didn't exercise a lot. 

Everyone is telling me I look better and healthier and this is concerning to me, since this wasn't an intended weight gain and was very sudden. Sometimes I see myself in the mirror and think that I still look good. Others I feel disgusting and I want to get back to my terrible old habits.   
 Controlling my weight is among my priorities at the moment and I hate this, since my life would offer many other pleasures. I keep looking my pics from 4 months ago and miss how I looked.

  
Rationally I know I need therapy but I don't want to be a financial strain on my parents. So I decided I want to go to a nutritionist but I don't know if it would be enough, since my struggle is clearly a mental one. 

  
I wanted to tell my dad since he's the only person close to me who noticed I lost weight two years ago. My mum would probably just freak out. But he already has many problems and this would just worry him. I have coped on my own when I was practically a zombie, why should I tell him now that I'm actually healthier?   


So. Is telling him superfluous or do I actually need to tell him I'm having a hard time w/life? (he has high blood pressure, wouldn't want to make him worry too much) ",Relaxed

2565,"Dealing with depression in a happy relationship. Have you?  hi! has anyone here dealt with depression in a relationship? i could use some help.

i‚Äôve struggled with high functioning clinical depression for years, the worst of it being my sophomore year of college, which prompted me to start an antidepressant. it didn‚Äôt get rid of my problems, but definitely helped lessen the low lows and crying days. fast forward to senior year, i stopped my meds thinking that life was about to feel a lot easier with graduating and getting a great internship somewhere i was very interested in. i was wrong, and honestly haven‚Äôt felt the same since stopping my meds at that time.

graduating did happen, but took an extra semester due to me not being able to get work done fast enough. internship was great, but it didn‚Äôt lead to a full time role like i hoped, and i‚Äôm now looking for a new job in this crazy market. my (newly divorced) family lives hours away and my friends have mostly gone back to our hometown, so i need to make new ones. i love my parents and miss them a lot when i feel like this, but never planned on going back to stay there due to dysfunction. 

i (22f) live in my college city with my partner (25m) of 2 years who i love completely! we have a very peaceful and affectionate relationship and want to get married in a couple years. i want to get better for my own health, but our relationship motivates me, too. 

still, depression is taking a big toll on me lately. i don‚Äôt like hiding my emotions from him, but i do most of the time to keep from seeming‚Ä¶ crazy or weak or unworthy i guess. (the depression is also not always so bad. it ebbs and flows, so i try not to show it each time it ‚Äúflares up‚Äù.) 
it gets exhausting hiding depression in my own home, though, so sometimes i don‚Äôt. the thing is, he doesn‚Äôt know how to interact with me in that state and/or gets frustrated that he can‚Äôt help. i just try to remind him that his love brings me joy, that i‚Äôm committed to working on myself, and that by no means do i believe it‚Äôs his job to make me happy. 
i don‚Äôt want to ruin my relationship nor lay around ruminating, so i try to get back to acting normal, doing the cooking and cleaning and embracing intimacy and such, but i just feel so off. in my normal state, i‚Äôd enjoy these things naturally. it‚Äôs driving me nuts that i feel this way and he has a very limited understanding of it. he‚Äôs never dealt with depression. 
i know i need professional help. i got back on meds recently but they haven‚Äôt kicked in yet, so depression is winning at the moment along with mood swings. i just want to feel better. positive advice/testimonies welcomed!

side note: i do go to the gym (inconsistently), have done talk therapy which is ok. would really like psychiatric help but it seems a bit hard to get.",Relaxed

It has been my exams for the past one month and day after tomorrow is my last exam. And im really stressed. Please dont discard this saying its normal for a student.
For the past ~3 months i have been studying without an ounce of entertainment or relaxation. due to various reasons my schoool started out late and i had to cover my entire syllabus in less amount of time. I had to pull allnighter for several days. while the other days, i slept only for 3-4 hours. I think this has badly affected my mental health. My parents always tell me to not strain yourself too much, but I am anxious and scared about my grades.

Apparently i think i could perform only average on all of my tests this year. im 11th grader and im seriously anxious about my grades.

Now this is not the real problem at hand. I have strained myself too much to an extent that I cant feel anything anymore. I have completely lost interest in scoring good grades, instead all I want is now is to finish the tests and sleep peacefully if its possible. Still i dont think its possible bc after the exams, I would be pretty anxious and i cant stand it anymore. I have an headache everytime i feel distressed and I feel the urge to sleep.

I tried reading some books and watching movies, I couldn't feel anything. Like if i tried reading a book, I will read it and probably feel nothing. My mind is elsewhere and I dont even know what im reading. Same goes for movies and other entertainment. I scroll through reddit or youtube hoping to find some fun, but its depressing too.

2569,"[20M] [20F] partners mental illness is sabotaging her physical health and my mental health  I (20m) think I might want out. My partner (20f) is mentally ill with PTSD, mild depression and extremely severe anxiety. That alone is not the reason I may want to separate, it‚Äôs what her mental illness has begun causing that is. 

My partners anxiety and  has begun sabotaging her own physical health, and she has started self destructing. She recently found out she may have a life threatening illness. She went into the ER, began testing, but upon attempting the last test (CT scan) she had an anxiety attack in the machine. They wanted to sedate her and try again later, but because of her unwillingness to be sedated (again due to anxiety) she walked straight out of the hospital against medical advice not knowing if she has an illness that suddenly kills some of those who have it. 

This is one example. Another being the fact that she will do anything to steer clear of drugs that are designed to help her mental health. As a result, it‚Äôs began to effect the relationship. She doesn‚Äôt always see it, but the issues her health is causing is subsequently deteriorating my own mental health, especially seeing her not accept the care and testing she needs. I know it isn‚Äôt her fault, but it‚Äôs began taking a toll on me. I recently had a talk with her, and she claimed she was setting up appointments with people who can get her the right treatment. 

She‚Äôs taken the time to set up an appointment to try the CT scan again today, and while she does appear to at least be taking steps to start getting her health under control, I have doubts about how far it‚Äôll really go even if she continues therapy that she started again yesterday (which she‚Äôs been out of for three weeks), gets seen further about her physical health, and stays on top of her meds which seem to hardly help anyways.

She has seemed to have planted a flag yesterday/today and has made numerous appointments and promises to take her meds and do what she needs to do and claims that it wasn‚Äôt because I said she needed to or I‚Äôd leave, but because it was a wake up call for her. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs keeping me around.

Is it immoral to want to leave someone in such a time? This is not really her doing, however my mental health is being strained.

Hello, these last couple of years I(f22) have been having depressive periods, usually just after ""experiencing"" something that makes me very happy.

I still do theater and this same production is happening again this yearüòä. But from September 2023 to January 2024 I had a semester abroad and I met a bunch of beautiful people who I became best friends with, whom I now miss greatly. I missed home, but I miss them, I miss my life there and how I lived and I find my life here boring and I want to change some things. I have a couple months left of school now. I am doing my thesis, which is fun, but I regret everything, I wish I had chosen something else, I wish I worked alone and not let my friend talk me into working together. There is nothing I can do about that now and I'm making the best of it. I'm doing my best and it'll be very good if it works, but working together is straining our friendship and we fight alot...but never about the project. We are stressed about time and if our project is even gonna work. I'm tired, I'm burnt out and I just want to be done, but there is still so much left to do. I had a little break down today after our midway evaluation hehe(can probably guess how that went) and I kinda just told her that I was tired and upset and she told me ""to try and not be"", then told me I had to talk to her, and later sent me texts about at least talking someone and theeeeen sends me a documentary about how mental health is a scam.

The thing is that for about a year I have been living in some kind of hell, my body and mind behave extremely strange. In addition to the above fear and apathy, I also have symptoms in the form of intrusive thoughts - In the form of a sudden desire to either kiss a sudden stranger or on the contrary to hit him. Pressure in the head - A feeling as if something presses in the area of the top of the head on the left, it is also in a piggy bank of incomprehensible sensations in the head, also I feel as if this body does not belong to me as well as I am not in this reality. About intrusive thoughts I would like to add that I hold myself back, but this restraint puts some unpleasant pressure on me. Sometimes I wanted to scream, either from the pressure or just my mind wanted it, but I also had to hold back and suffer.  
I often have problems with ""falling out of reality"", most often it happened after playing games (I play a lot of computer games, 8 hours approximately) - when I get away from the computer it's like I can't fully perceive the real life, it seems like I'm in a place unknown to me and everything around is alien, which is definitely scary.  
So, all this baggage has been tormenting me for a long time...I'm wondering if anyone can give advice on what it could be and how I can get rid of this horror? (Well, or explain it's all related to one disease or is it all different diseases?). Thank you for your attention.

I really want to help him but I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I think he needs to detox from some of the meds he‚Äôs been taking, possibly find different meds which will work for him, fix or improve his sleep and take care of his body by eating a healthier diet and exercising. 


I feel like he thinks there‚Äôs no hope for him but I won‚Äôt give up. What kind of professionals would be appropriate to help him kickstart his life again? He mentioned before wanting to get committed to a substance abuse facility to help him get clean from all the meds (which at this point he‚Äôs basically addicted to them, although they‚Äôre legal and prescribed drugs).

I‚Äôm wondering because I‚Äôve felt this all my life and it‚Äôs really starting to weigh on me. I feel like once something annoys/upsets me no matter what, this lingering pressure behind my eyes stays as if I‚Äôm about to cry and I feel like I want to cry sometimes too. For example, I‚Äôm at the beach right now on a beach day with my sister and mom. My mom deals with directions really badly and gets flustered in a bad way where she gets mad and stuff and when I try to help (whether asked or not) I always get questioned and told no and get anything from a annoyed tone to an angry tone and it makes me upset. I know that‚Äôs just her and she‚Äôs fine once things are figured out but it really bothers me and then I can‚Äôt stop ruminating about it. I think it‚Äôs fucking stupid but the pressure is still there and I want to cry and I don‚Äôt know why. It‚Äôs fucking stupid, I‚Äôm a dude too arent I supposed to be so repressed that I don‚Äôt cry over dumb shit like this? 

Idk, I feel a lot like whenever I try to help or explain something or say something I always get misinterpreted and it makes me feel like I‚Äôm crazy. My family makes me feel like I‚Äôm crazy because I feel like I‚Äôm just trying to understand the other person and have them say more and for some reason it‚Äôs met with hostility and now I‚Äôm the bad one because I was just trying to explain myself or have someone explain so I can understand. I always get this pressure afterwards, and it can linger for so long and I start thinking up possible scenarios where things like this will happen again later and it‚Äôs so self-destructive and I just want it to stop.

2585,"I lost my father today (+long update)  It‚Äôs been almost a year since I‚Äôve reached out to this subreddit. Last year I talked about some sort of mental health decline, and how I was doing badly in school and that my mom wouldn‚Äôt listen to me. I took the summer to recover, but it didn‚Äôt do much, and I only started to notice that I‚Äôve been developing more bad habits, mostly in my eating habits and sleeping habits. These habits started to occur since November, and I got a really bad leg strain a week before Christmas break, yet I still have it to this day. All of this is making it hard for me to concentrate and to accomplish my daily tasks. 

Not only that, during the same month of December, a cancer in my father was back for revenge after years of being dormant. He‚Äôs been going to the hospital more and more, and I was often home alone due to being unable to help from my leg strain. The New Years were very depressing because I was home alone with one of my two brothers, with our second brother out to a party. Our mom didn‚Äôt come back from the hospital until after midnight. Immediately a bad start to the year, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to get so much worse.

Sometime in early January, I talked with a social worker who was willing to hear me out. I talked about everything that‚Äôs been bothering me, from my decline of last year, to my change in habits, my father‚Äôs illness, my injured leg, all of it. They figured that I had some form of depression, though I‚Äôm not too sure. I‚Äôll have to meet up with a psychiatrist to know for sure.

Monday, my father got two infections after being weakened by the chemo to fight the cancer, and was immediately rushed to the hospital. I didn‚Äôt see him at all until Friday, where I was allowed to visit him. Just upon seeing me, he gave me a sweet smile. He could barely speak, but I gave him my best wishes. I promised him that things will get better and that we‚Äôll be able to be together again, as a family. Little did I know, that would be my very last time seeing him.

Today, my mom and second brother went to the hospital early, along with other family members. In the early evening, my mom and brother came home, and I was called down from my bedroom. When I saw my brothers and mom at the living room, I knew something was up- then the words ‚Äúpapa‚Äôs gone‚Äù completely destroyed me. 

He was suffering so greatly, but now he‚Äôs at peace. I don‚Äôt know how many hours I spent crying, especially heartbroken by the fact that I never got a chance to say goodbye to him. I have a feeling this loss would very much worsen my mental health, and that I would need to talk to a psychiatrist.

It‚Äôs exam week, and I only have one exam on Thursday, so I guess I‚Äôm lucky that I can take the week off to take it easy. We‚Äôre going to take the time to figure things out, and set up his funeral. By then, I‚Äôll be able to give him a proper farewell, though I know well he wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear my words. 

I had hoped that he would still be alive for my eighteenth birthday in March, I could‚Äôve wished for his recovery. But I was told to be prepared for the worst, and yet, I sure as hell wasn‚Äôt. 

I don‚Äôt know how this will affect the years ahead of me, for I‚Äôll be out of school in a few months and heading onto the next step of my life. I think finding the right therapist and talking to my friends would be the best thing for me to do now.

My head is starting to hurt from all the hours of crying. I think I‚Äôll try to go to sleep early tonight to hopefully calm down, though I have a feeling I won‚Äôt be able to sleep from all of this.

This isn‚Äôt really a cry for help, I just wanted to write out my feelings about everything. Wherever my father is right now, I hope he‚Äôs happy and safe, for he no longer needs to suffer from such a horrible disease. 

I hope one day, my promise will be granted, and that we will all be together as a family again. But until that day comes, it‚Äôll just be me, my mother, my brothers, my cats, and my extended family. 

Thank you for hearing me out, I really appreciate it. I wish you all a good night, since I know this night will not be peaceful for me. 

Take care of yourselves.

I am 29, a full time student, I commute about an hour each way, have a 13 yo and a 6 yo, and my husband just finished up his chemo therapy treatments for cancer. The cancer almost killed him earlier this year, but chemo is a miracle of science and he is in remission now. It's been difficult since I started back at school during the pandemic, with various other family drama happening. We found out something horrific about my father in law in 2020, so we no longer speak to him, and this was a huge strain on my husbands and my relationship. Then in 2022 My husband formed too close of a relationship with a coworker (almost or emotional cheating I guess) which was probably because of emotional reeling from excommunicating his dad and my being really busy at school. And this year, my husband was in two car accidents (neither of which was his fault) and then the cancer. I'm sure all of this going on has been part of why I am having trouble managing school, but idk, I've wanted to finish my degree for years. I dropped out after we got married, and we were finally in a position for me to return, and then the world went into quarantine and my like has been on fire ever since. I have been doing okay with school thus far, passing just about everything and doing fine. But this semester, I dunno, im hitting a wall. Im behind in everything.

I used to be anxious about the weight I was gaining, I kept seeing myself as fat and I would often eat large amounts of food and puke it up immediately after, then eat more food only to puke that up as well. This actually caused me to gain weight If anything, likely because I was eating more than usual even if I was purging it immediately after, I believe the body retains immense caloric intake even If the food is expelled immediately after. I began getting really bad heartburn, especially when I drank alcohol and quickly figured it was from the strain on my lower esophageal sphincter- food was not meant to go back through it that way too often- it got so bad and so often that I just quit cold turkey and never looked back because I recognized that it was a bad path to be taking.

2591,"Did I mess up my brain permanently??  
This year has been a shit show for me and I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll get better once I change my medicine.

I began taking Lamotrigine 25 mg last year to deal with intense mood swings. Near the beginning of this year my psychiatrist bumped it up to 100 mg. 

I started by taking half a pill then remained on half until she told me I need to be taking the full pill. By the time I started taking the full pill I had a few major panic attacks, which led me to the ER. Waste of $$$ and time. 

This happened in March and I was never the same. I had strained my neck and back around that time as well so I‚Äôve been under a lot of stress. Seeing the chiropractor helped the muscle strain but my mental health was getting worse. 

I made a career switch during the summer and suffered constant anxiety attacks, and got COVID for the first time. Then I moved in with my sister and things got worse. 

I already know this was dumb but I was smoking marijuana. For the longest smoking or taking edibles hasn‚Äôt seemed to affect me in the slightest until delta 8 was thrown into the mix. I had these Koi gummies and they fucked me up so bad I stopped everything altogether. 

I had a few bad trips on and off. The last straw was when I had a trip so bad I thought I was actually loosing my mind. I was in a dark place and thought I‚Äôd be a danger to others. I threw that shit away and continued to take my medicine. 

At one point even taking my medicine was causing me distress. I was already having intense intrusive thoughts and mood swings. Every time I took my pill it seem to make things feel even worse. (Side note: I went back to taking half the pill again months before this happened). 

Im really scared I did some damage because I haven‚Äôt been the same since the bad trip. Every single day is a gamble because sometimes I‚Äôll be completely fine and others I‚Äôm feeling sick or extremely emotional. 

Ive been in contact with my therapist and psychiatrist but I lost faith in my psychiatrist because she‚Äôs not too helpful. I finally am scheduled to see her on Wednesday. 

I get massive brain fog, high blood pressure time to time, insomnia (which is new), and extreme panic attacks/psychosis possibly.

I get it into my head that they're talking about me or something I did and it strains my relationship with them.

Those feelings of paranoia have and always were unfounded, but the only reason that I know this is because I had to use immoral methods to find out. I've lost sleep, had nightmares, and ruined relationships that weren't even mine because of this. Recently though I don't feel that I can empathize with my friends or their problems as well as I used to be able to. It feels like I can't form relationships of any kind without this eventually bubbling back up, I want my friends to be able to look at me and feel comfortable confiding in me but it feels impossible as every friend I have it feels like I'm going to eventually think they're against me in some way.

In highschool, I ended up ruining the friend group over something insignificant all because it felt like actual physical pain whenever something would happen that didn't include me.

We've made a lot of progress in helping me navigate my tumultuous relationship with my toxic/abusive/narcissistic mother and family. However, life has followed on with its bumps in the road and I've repeatedly lapsed back into depression.

Over the course of the past year and a half I've also been working with a psychiatrist to try to treat my energy/focus/motivation issues from a medication standpoint too. Recently, I started taking Lexapro.

My feeling, right now, is that I've reached the end in terms of how much help therapy can offer me. I'm sick of talking about my relationship with my mom and no matter how many times I try to cojole my therapist into talking about the future she returns the conversation to that.

I also strongly believe that, right now, my depression is chemical. And that finding the adequate dose of an antidepressant is going to be key to getting me out of this rut. Right now, every day is somewhat challenging. But I hope that I'll soon start to lift out of this place. And that staying there will be the next objective.

Finally, the ongoing cost of therapy is posing a major strain on my finances which are already strained from job-related difficulties. This has been a stressor for as long as I've been going to a therapist. And I feel that adding stressors to your life is kind of counterproductive to the objective of getting mentally well!

My wife insists that I need to be in therapy for as long as I feel down and offers to borrow money from her parents to held cover the costs but ... my gut instinct is telling me that it's not helping and that I just don't need or want any more of it.

Is it okay to be 'done' with therapy? I've felt like it served a purpose but that my future recovery is going to come from other directions.

The first half of the marriage was good but after we had a child my ex changed. She would no longer allow me to have access to knowing what we paid in bills, I was only allowed to work a low paying job at her company, and she constantly made me feel like I was trash and that it was a miracle I had someone as good as her.

2599,"(23F) Successful professional relationships, unsuccessful personal ones    
I recently moved city and I found myself in the same situation as I did in the past: being unable to turn professional relationships into personal relationships.

In a work relationship, what keeps people together is the thing they are working on. Conversations are mainly focused on that thing. In a personal relationship, what keeps people together is sharing themselves with the other. Conversations are mainly focused on personal stuff.

I can establish work relationships easily: if the object of the relationship is a project we work on together, then everything goes smoothly. I always find great chemistry with the people I work with. When it's time to turn a working relationship into a personal one, everything stops being so smooth. When the object of the relationship becomes me, when I have to share myself to keep up the relationship, I fail at it.

For example, at the moment I am working on academic research with some people. I love working with them. We go on well and we have many things in common. Many elements could represent a great base for building a friendship, a good one. But the deadline for this project is in two weeks and I am afraid that, once it is over, our relationship will also be over.It's not a matter of ""invite them out"" or ""find a way to keep in touch"". I do that. The problem is that on those occasions, I find it hard to open up to people. The relationship feels strained and it eventually dies. I can't ever nurture a connection with somebody. I make that connection fade away.

I worked hard on myself in the past years to solve some past traumas and get out of some patterns and I can state that I was successful at it for the best part. I changed a lot and I grew a lot. But this is still something I can't figure out still.

I pretty much know what are the reasons why this happens to me, the problem is I don't really know how to act about it and make a change. Has anybody some advice on how to navigate this?

2607,"Why do I always avoid people ?  I‚Äôm a 25(M) and I‚Äôve seen a pattern within myself over the years and the pattern is that I avoid dealing with people as much as I can on the daily basis. 

(Sometimes even family & it does not mean I don‚Äôt love them or appreciate them ) 

I do consider myself a very delightful person, who‚Äôs willing to always help others if asked and always takes others into consideration yet very cautious when people would like to be friends or hangout beyond that point. 

The reason is because my experience with having friends has brung along unwanted stress for me. 

For example, 
Dealing with their personal problems 
Imbalance of consideration towards me
Secret animosity 
& other negative factors 

I was wondering if I‚Äôm the only one who feels like this towards people ? Or maybe I‚Äôm just too empathetic that I deeply feel others emotions without wanting to ? 

I don‚Äôt consider myself anti-social & I don‚Äôt become anxious in a crowded room but my avoidance is very high when people want to become friends a bit more seriously. (Like hanging out or going out)",Relaxed

i have been a group facilitator for many years, but i always struggled with barriers in organization semantics (ex. nami) or mandated attendance, etc.

this is my first opportunity to develop and lead my own group that will be reputably promoted and supported - i am delighted.  it is going to be a creative writing group to process grief and trauma (name tbd but i am liking ""words healing wounds"").

i know that i want it to be open door (so not a workshop) but also task-based (so a linear start/finish per meeting).  i would love to find some resources for facilitation themes/approaches and also connecting content. or please be my resource here! i am a cpc and the best education (ever, period) is through peers (always, period).

i have a degree in journalism from eight lifetimes ago that i can lean into, the tools in my baggage/lived experience/inpatient worksheets (lol y'all) and the hours of facilitations spent on learning what not to do. i feel like some specific/relative direction would really tie this into some confidence!

- discussion topics for grief/trauma groups

But deep down you know that you‚Äôre doing the right thing, being responsible. So the noise that was there before starts to fade away. You accept yourself more.

This is such a hard topic to wrap you head around. With all this chaos and suffering and destruction in the world it all just seems like randomness and without purpose. That there is no exact explanation for anything. Are we suck in a loop? Lost in our thoughts, without any understanding? What is clarity? How can we actually understand what is going on around us? Who or what do we look for to find this clarity? We aren‚Äôt just existing on earth for the sake of existing. if in the end you will forget everything? Do you still think there is purpose to find happiness even if hardship comes along with it? Do you want to remember your highest points and everyone you care about, even if you‚Äôll still be weighed down by sorrows and empty feelings? Or is it better to forget? There is clarity. Through the world‚Äôs disorder there is perfect order. We are not just existing. We will not forget. We were made for a purpose, by God our father. We are made to serve him in all we do. That is our purpose. God is not selfish, we are. God gives us answers but if we don‚Äôt look to him we will never find them. Serve God with your whole heart, soul and mind because that is the order God made you to follow. God gives us clarity. I know this doesn‚Äôt sound like a delightful way to live. That‚Äôs our selfish nature talking. Look around you at least you were created, you could still be dust if God didn‚Äôt care. You have a choice to seek order in the total randomness or seeking God to be your life‚Äôs cornerstone. he gives you purpose. If you want your life to continue even after death. Jesus is your Answer. Turning your life over to Him you will be granted with eternal life. Life in happiness with God and those you love. Make more of those happy memories without being dragged down by sin or sorrow.

 I‚Äôm autistic and I went full shutdown.

The trigger was that he made me late to my therapy appointment. I hadn‚Äôt been able to go in a while.  

This has never happened to me before. (Being triggered or at least this badly)

Me and my therapist talked about it when I was there and I had to make an emergency appointment for tomorrow this morning because I still feel so bad.

I‚Äôd been exhausted. I mean Exhausted. Panicked.
The exhaustion had me tired after I woke up. That got better. I was able to stay awake yesterday for the first time since that Friday. I thought this was getting better. 

Then I think I triggered myself again? I watched a horror kdrama? I‚Äôve never seen one before. I don‚Äôt watch shows due to concentration issues. It is one with ghosts called the guest. I adored it. I loved it a lot but‚Ä¶

Last night I had a horrendous nightmare. Like so bad. When I woke up, the dark scared me as much as it did when I was a kid. I didn‚Äôt want to set foot off the bed because I thought something would grab it. That wasn‚Äôt even in the show.

I knew it was all irrational because I got rid of those fears ages ago. I used to be actually terrified of ghosts, I‚Äôm not afraid of ghosts anymore. I‚Äôm still not afraid of ghosts. I worked hard for that. 

I wasn‚Äôt even scared of what was going on in the show. I was delighted, but I can‚Äôt dismiss the possibility of it being another trigger. 

I got back to sleep but woke up 3hrs later. I‚Äôm still so shaky. I feel like crying. 

Is this normal for a trigger event? 

All I can really do is do my exercises and wait until tomorrow. I just feel terrified. I hate this. I already plan to tell my therapist this. I just need some reassurance right now. I feel very attacked? Is I guess how I‚Äôd describe it. 

I feel like I‚Äôm dying. I know I‚Äôm not. I haven‚Äôt felt this way since I was young .It‚Äôs making me angry because I can‚Äôt even push myself into my good health things. I was going to cook today, but my concentration is shot. I‚Äôm shaky. I‚Äôm terrified and so, so angry.

I smear it all over my hands and enjoy looking at it. The more i manage to bleed the greater my satisfaction. I did the same today and to my delight i drew out more blood than i have ever before and managed to cover a sizable portion of my hands and arms with it.

But then in 9th grade (I couldnt join in the previous year‚Äôs team bcuz of covid), I decided to join the basketball team and thought it would be fun. It was not. It gave me so much anxiety (along w school anxiety) and I didnt have the confidence to play well like I did in elementary. Plus, my team was toxic, the coaches had favoritism, no one communicated, there was always tension. It was prolly one of the reasons why our team made it far, but not far enough. Everyone had something to say about this team.

My anxiety got so bad I skipped joining the team in 10th grade. I dont remember practicing basketball consistently EVER in that yr either. It‚Äôs like I quit the sport after my experience on that team. 

Now that I‚Äôm older, I don‚Äôt have that same passion for basketball anymore. I don‚Äôt think about it, I don‚Äôt play it as a hobby, and I don‚Äôt watch it. But my mind wants to keep going.

I‚Äôm at a family gathering. A relative is present and was just speaking about how good the year had been to him and how fortunate he was to have had such a good time of it. 

I congratulated him as everyone else did and he asked me how I was doing. I hid how shitty this year had been and I tried to smile and say I‚Äôd been alright but it must‚Äôve showed on my face cause he asked me if I really was alright and then tried to do that comforting pat thing and tell me that things would get better eventually.

It was as if all the anger and rage about my situation came back in that one moment of fury. At that moment, I wanted nothing more than to tear that arm off and beat him to death with it or to shove his face into a woodchipper, but I managed to barely keep cool.

I thanked him for his well wishes and quickly went to the bathroom, which is where I am right now trying to calm down and find out what‚Äôs going on with me.

I should be grinning from ear to ear. Well I'm not. I don't feel much of anything. I only just barely passed and my grade is terrible. I'm somewhat disappointed with the whole thing. I went in four years ago with such high hopes, I was convinced I would blow them all away with my superior intellect and reasoning. Bollocks. That wore off after one semester and I went back to being a lazy fuckin. Skipped classes, left all assignments to the last minute. Depression and anxiety got the best of me, as usual.

2626,"Nothing will turn my life around  On a previous post, I received a comment that prompted me to give interacting with other people another try. The comment centered on the idea that humans are social creatures despite how lonely one may be. That comment really made me rethink. It made me question whether or not people would actually listen to you if I just smoothly ease them into a personal conversation. Easy target of course, my family members. I joined them on a trip of some sorts. My mom, dad, my two sisters, and I were to look around inquiring for colleges my sister could enroll in. By luck, I ended up in a situation wherein I was sitting between my mom and one of my sisters. The situation was BEGGING for me to start a topic. And so I did. I brought up a topic about a technical problem I had for the entirety of the last school year(It's still online classes in my country). My mom was already made aware of this since back then. I was really delighted that I had the chance to have this conversation. But as a sick joke from the gods above, I came to realize I was completely mislead by this opportunity. Because as the conversation went on, it became obvious neither wanted to talk to me. They kept repeatedly asking me the same questions hoping it would tire me out and make me stop my loud obnoxious talking. At some point they'd even branch off to another conversation excluding me but do it subtly enough as to not make their intentions obvious. At one point, they even asked a very irrelevant question when I brought up PTC. My mom replied to it, locking eyes with my sister, with ""Parent-teacher...what's the last one?"". This of course is not verbatim but you get the point. These people actively hate me. I don't even talk to them so what gave them the impression that I'm a bad person? How come they wouldn't give me a chance? Fuck. I really really am hopeless. I'm not even looking for advice anymore or anything. I just want to get that out of the way. Why do you guys hate me when you rarely see me do shit? What gave you the impression that I'm to be hated?",Relaxed
2627,"Most basic ""How do I start?!"" tips/help/ANYTHING needed  Hi. This is a long story, and I don't really know where to start. But without getting TOO deep into my family history and all my mental health struggles... Here goes.

I am a 28 year old (gender not disclosed because that's a different problem, baby steps here) who is currently dealing with... life. My mental health issues started when I was 14, and was rejected by the first love of my life. I spent a year kind of moping around about it, just thinking it was a broken heart. I got through it without medication or therapy, and I was like, ""Alright, well the rest of my life is gonna be good, right?""

The rest of high school was kinda rough on me. Junior year was an overall positive. Senior year was hell, I suffered from SEVERE depression and occasional panic attacks, eventually leading to a one evening hospitalization where I was finally medicated for depression and panic attacks (and starting to tear up now shows that I guess I'm still not over it! GREAT!)

For me at the time, being prescribed with antidepressants and panic disorder meds was a massive blow to my self image. I thought I was weak, I knew all my friends weren't on them, and I felt like a freak. Being on them didn't help at all, and I maintain that they're still not amazing, but I'll get more into that in a second. 

So, off our delightful little ticking timebomb went to college. Freshman year was hell, depression and panic attacks again, and underlying symptoms of what I think is ADHD show up- Unable to remember stuff, constantly a mess, just doing something I like for literally 8 hours on end without eating. I will honestly attest to buying The Binding of Isaac on Steam for $3 (Impulsive spending) and just sitting at my desk for the rest of the day playing it, with eating breaks in between. 

These patterns continued, depression on the backburner more or less, panic attacks gone. But again, can't keep my room clean to save my life, procrastinate my work and even end up hoping off my homework to do more fun things after 5 minutes. I made it through college only thanks to a professor who was super delightful and was like, ""Hey, EndMyBadCycle, just do what you can, ask me for help as much as you need, we'll get you through this.""

Post college graduation, my life kind of turns to shit! No panic attacks (since graduation I think I've only had like 1 or 2? Small victories, I suppose), but I'm losing contact with all my friends, working a job not in my education, becoming deeply bitter. I only moved out of my folks' house a year and a half ago after literally having no friends save for a teeny tiny online community.

I don't how much of any of that is useful yet, but here's the point:

I NEED HELP, ASAP. I'm not in any danger at the moment, but... Like, I literally barely manage my life. I have zero barriers, I don't feel like a functioning human being, I can't stick to any patterns... Like, I don't feel like I have any sense of my life, and I'm wasting this time.

Basically, where do I start? I need help with my ADHD, but that's so freaking unconquerable. Literally every time I try to start something new, I abandon it within \*literal days\*. Hell, I'm not even sure I'm going to remember to read or respond to these comments, because even when I seek help, the advice I take just... goes unused. My apartment is a mess, I need to work out but I can't keep a solid habit to do so. I spend all of my paychecks on useless shit that I forget about in a week. I have a therapy bill that I keep forgetting to pay, like, it's not a matter of ""Get help,"" it's a matter of ""I've gotten help but I can't use it."" I need the most basic ass, first step, ""HERE IS HOW YOU BREATHE"" help to get at least some of my life on course. Like, I want to be able to maintain relationships and not wake up and doomscroll tik tok (That is a problem, I KNOW) for an hour instead of being productive.

I am going to TRY to respond to this, I am going to TRY to take this advice, but if I do not, do not take it personally. I have accidentally ghosted really nice people that I have nothing against.",Relaxed

I can‚Äôt help but feel like it‚Äôs off somehow. Like a failure to set and maintain boundaries I guess?

I grew up in a village where most people earned like 100 dollars a month.

My parents were fed up of their poverty and thought that they should send me to a good up-class school so at-least we could get out of that shit-hole.

My story:
Everyone in my village would see me as some sort of experiment which they wished to fail.

I didn't have a friend in my village because I had developed a different mindset going to the school which didn‚Äôt fit with anyone in my village.

In school, it was really an embarrassment for me because first of all I had to go there on a bicycle and everyone had cars and they had to travel shorter distances than me.  
I‚Äôd have to lie about where I lived most of the time.
I could never invite anyone to my home as we lived in a 2bhk with a family of 4 and would always have to refuse when someone invited me to their home.  
I could never throw parties on my birthday.  
I never had a girlfriend in school.  
I wore the same set of clothes to school every other day.  
I didn't have a computer or a wifi connection at my home.  
I never had any money to go out with anyone for Socializing.  
I always had to lie about my parent's profession.

I was studying on a scholarship and everyone knew it, when I scored good grades the teachers would see me as ""Aww! he is poor, so he would have to work hard every year, I feel sorry"";   
when my grades were poor, they said: ""Never ever should have his parents spent this much on his education"". Sometimes, my father would beat the shit out of me when that happened.  
Both reactions made me feel bad.

My mother was always crying in the kitchen at home because of our tight household.  


I grew up in a sense of embarrassment and shame without even doing anything. I had no friends whatsoever, My family was emotionally abusive.

One time, a boy from my class invited me to his home and I was delighted to be visiting somebody‚Äôs home for the first time but his mother asked me in the first moment about what my father did and I told her the truth and she made a face I can‚Äôt forget and stopped going anywhere.

2633,"Why am I extroverted with older adults, but introverted with people my own age?  My entire life, I‚Äôve thought I was an introvert. I‚Äôve always loved my quiet time and personal space. I have no problems being alone.

My life has truly changed once I started actually talking to people more. I have no idea where this side of me has come from. No matter where I‚Äôm at, I try to speak to people. I try to strike up a conversation with strangers. At the grocery store, laundromat, doctors office, etc. I try to just have a conversation with people.

But I, for the life of me, can‚Äôt talk to people my own age. I‚Äôm 21, and I just don‚Äôt get along with my fellow peers. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt speak the same language as them. It‚Äôs like we have nothing in common. 

It sounds odd, but one of my best friends is a woman named Lu, who is a cashier at the local rite aid. She‚Äôs 56, and we could talk for hours. We just went to the laundromat and got lunch after. But when it comes to a fellow 21 year old, I can barely talk to them for 10 mins without it getting awkward. 

Why is this? How do I change this?",Relaxed
2634,"Just diagnosed with severe anxiety, depression, and acute insomnia.  I am a 27F and was just diagnosed with all three mental illnesses in one sitting. I can‚Äôt decide if I am beyond validated and relieved, or absolutely horrified that I‚Äôve been letting it control me for so long. I was told that because of the severity and combination, I‚Äôve probably been experiencing times of complete disassociation- losing track of chunks of times/memories and acting out in ways that are not like me, like someone else is driving my meat suit, if you will. 

Due to the nature of my job and COVID trauma, on top of the delightful trifecta, the symptoms of all three have been amplified and my doctors said I was basically gripping onto anything I could control/find in reality to stay afloat. 

And get this- all I need to do is take some meds and start talking to someone and I should be able to go back to a normal state. I have been ugly crying all day about it. I can‚Äôt even imagine ‚Äònormal‚Äô living anymore.",Relaxed
2635,"BDD Head Shape Hair Loss  I literally can't function anymore, I believe I need help. I see the definition of BDD is a perceived disorder. I've had quite a few people tell me directly and indirectly that I have an unusual shaped head. 

I used to be so confident, until people started saying things like ""You got a big forehead"" , ""I'm glad I'm not balding, I got a weird headshot like yours"", and ""You must have had a tough life"". I had some people gesture to their head looking at me and take a picture while laughing and calling their family over. 

Everytime shit like this happens I secretly want to die inside. I used to be so fun loving and confident light up a room by joking etc... Now the only way I can do it is while wearing a hat. I secretly hate the people who make these comments, so much that I want to kill them. 

Anytime people smile at me, or strike up a conversation now I get so delighted. Any small amount of kindness literally makes my day until the next conversation results in them talking to my head while grimacing (via eye contact) then it's all over again.


I understand that I probably am more uncomfortable with my appearance than anybody else, but I feel like I'm in a negative feedback loop of misery and pain that emanates outwards and gets these reactions. The social anxiety is killing me, even the days I look nice I get negative reactions. It's ruining my relationships, because my girlfriend has never said anything but her mother and her husband said something about it which caused me such anxiety about going around here or her family. 

I'm at my wits end and am thinking about killing myself because of it. I can't wear hats forever, I can't grow hair and I can't walk around giving a fuck what people think about me... But I can't help it, after receiving comments it starts to wear on you. Something that never used to bother me has become the bane of my existence.",Relaxed
2636,"Can't bounce back after COVID  How do you bounce back?

During the lockdown last year, I hit a big low and, even though life \*feels\* similar to how it did before the pandemic, I can't seem to bounce back spiritually.

Prior to the pandemic, I was so busy and had to work to cultivate an appreciation of the present moment, and got really into meditation & exercise to ground myself. It also used to be that if I had a day off, I'd find something to inspire and delight me. 

Then during the pandemic all the present moments that I had struggled to appreciate started to accrue into a meaningless mass, a big tub of gloop, an endless string of utterly pointless NOW, with nothing to do, no one to talk to, nowhere to go, no joy. 

Lost family and work that was a big part of my identity during COVID and had a very small dose of Prozac to get through that time, and it worked: I am still alive.

But there are things to do again, places to see, people to talk to, joy to feel. I force myself to do all sorts of stuff, then also sometimes give myself permission to rest, set goals, forgive myself for feeling XYZ. 

Then on a day like today, when I'm off work, any and all free time just sort of feels like torture all over again.   

How to reestablish a more joyful baseline?",Relaxed
2637,"A filipino father's rant.  Hello, it's my first time to post here and I just want to tell my story. I have lost a really good job end of May this year (been there for almost three years) and I have been lucky to find a new one that pays almost the same. However I am not happy in this new job in the sense that I doubt I can really perform well in the long run, and that I don't think I can last that long in it. So I have been looking for a new job which my skills would fit in and so far I haven't found the right one. I also have to make sure that the next employment I land in will compensate enough for my family's monthly expenses. I have not been at peace at all this past work week and I kept thinking, if I quit now, either we won't have food on the table, or my debts are just gonna pile up again. 

I tell myself to just endure the current job while searching for a new one that I would be delighted to do, something that I would be passionate about, yet it is monday again and I dread coming back to work today. My wife is trying to help, and I appreciate her for that, it's just that she has not been able to find a job for herself to help me out with the finances. I am not mad at her or anything with what I am gonna say next but I hate that I am the only one in the household with an income to cover every single bill. 

We do not come from wealthy families, there's no one to turn to. If my wife and I stop working, our kids will go hungry. I wanna cry out for help but all I am gonna get is my echo. I am tired. I am tired of being poor. I am tired of not having a degree to make a decent living. I can only persevere and be patient as things fall into place as I know they will, but as of now, I am tired.",Relaxed

2639,"Maybe I'm mentally ill  Good afternoon, I think I have a little problem.

&#x200B;

Since childhood, I had thoughts and a feeling that my thinking was not quite right, not like other people, hobbies and interests as a child were also wrong (brought up by my mother, there was no father), there were serious problems with socialization (partly because outdoor games were impossible, football, running, just games with other children, due to heart disease). From about 4-5 years old, I realized that something was wrong in my behavior and perception of the world, and when someone didn't want to be friends with me or mocked me, I thought to myself, ""this is expected, I'm retarded."" Over time, I just plunged into stupid hobbies like video games, meaningless conversations on the Internet and reading various historical literature (a very stupid waste of time, it would be better to learn foreign languages or play sports). I intuitively could not understand other people, did not understand the norms of society, did not know how to behave, what to do and what to say all my youth, I had to look for answers on the Internet. 

&#x200B;

When I got into the army and was doing, let's say, ""bad things"", it was like I rediscovered myself. I, an unhealthy, weak and unsportsmanlike 18-year-old guy, really liked the physical effort, liked the pain and fatigue, I felt alive, that this is it, at least something worthwhile in life, I live for a reason. I really liked the weapons, shooting, running, pain, fatigue, I literally fell off my feet, spat out my lungs, defecated with blood, cried from the pain in my bones and I felt very good inside. But the worst, the most disgusting thing is that I felt even better when others were feeling bad. When our army started fighting in another country and other servicemen began to fear that they would be sent to war, I was glad, I laughed at their weakness and cowardice, I said that they would become real men there. When we had particularly difficult exercises where it was hard for everyone, where everyone was crying, experiencing discomfort and fatigue, I felt pleasure both from the fatigue of my body and from the discomfort of others. The misery and pain of others brought me happiness. When I took revenge on the offenders, and then just guys who did injustice (humiliated the weak, stole, and so on) I was even more delighted that I had brought them this misfortune.

&#x200B;

When I returned home, I realized that I didn't feel anything, I didn't have homesickness, I wasn't happy to return to my mother in my hometown. Faced with the fact that I am very rude, I can joke, offend, push people away without even knowing it, to joke too rudely for example. I became interested in the war, everything connected with it, heroism, dirt, strength, death, photos of dead bodies of soldiers delighted me, I dreamed of dying in an attack, so that they would bring me in a coffin to my hometown and a mourning orchestra would play, so that I would die for something when I was young. I found like-minded people, people who also went to war or were associated with it, literally sadists, psychopaths, drug addicts who shared my interests, we had common favorite writers, music, paintings, we all liked photos of bombed cities, paintings of Cubism, futurism and expressionism, which are usually called ""the daub of a child"". I became angrier, I thought looking at the other guys - why did I suffer in the trench, and you didn't? Why don't you suffer? I didn't feel sorry for myself, I just thought and probably continue to believe that only there, in the war, a man becomes something real, a man becomes a man. I could approach a friend or colleague, a student at the university and pat on the shoulder, say something offensive and ambiguous to hook or offend, quietly bring people up by mentioning what they don't like or reminding them of what hurts and makes them feel bad. When I see how uncomfortable I make a person feel, it's bad, I feel good. I just decided to play sports, work and save money to get into the army of another country and die in the war already there.

&#x200B;

At the same time, I did not feel and practically do not feel any other feelings - I tried delicious food, alcohol, cigarettes, I had relationships and sex with girls, none of this brought me pleasure, no emotions at all. In bed with a girl, I just move and think about something else, eating delicious food, as if I feel a slight aftertaste, as if I don't feel the taste at all. I have practically no fear, regret, empathy even for my mother, hatred or anger, I do not feel the desire to take revenge on someone, or offend, I do not feel love, I do not like any hobby, hobby, the only thing that gives me at least some pleasure besides the misfortune of others is sports, injury myself, the feeling of pain when running, muscle pain, or when I am extremely busy at work/school and have to work fast and hard. At the same time, it does not give me pleasure to see people die, for example, if an old woman is hit by a car or someone dies of a heart attack, I will not have any good emotions, but if one person beats another, is at enmity with him, if someone quarrels and watches from the sidelines, that's yes.

With all this in the army, I came to God (a Christian), and having received proof of the existence of God (I was just in a dangerous situation, prayed and returned home whole, not disabled) I truly believe in everything that is written in the Bible.

In life, I try to be kind and sympathetic, internally feeling disgusted with a weak or fat person, I always help him or offer help, spend my time, energy, listen, I can help with work for free, everyone considers me a sympathetic and good person. 

&#x200B;

I am very afraid that when my mom dies, my heart will not feel anything, I understand that it is necessary to have a family and children, but I am very afraid that I will not give a woman love, just because I will not understand her, I start every girl just to have sex that I don't like and because ""everyone needs to have a lover a person."" I'm looking, looking for what will give me happiness, what will show positive emotions in my soul, I try, change jobs, hobbies, try everything that is available and I don't like anything. I very rarely go to the shooting range to shoot a machine gun, do sports, read completely useless literature about history, wars, economics, even watch the same series and movies. I think I was like this from the very beginning, incomplete, wrong. A couple of psychologist friends said I was probably a psychopath. 

&#x200B;

With all this, I repeat, I did not feel and do not feel resentment or envy towards anyone, I do not remember being angry at a person at all, even if he did something bad to me personally, I did not know how to lie until I was 20 and did not understand what it was and how, that is, this is not the kind of bullshit like ""he was beaten at school and he got angry at the whole world and decided to take it back,"" nope. I feel like a broken and incomplete person, and how do I live on, and most importantly why I just don't understand. I would have committed suicide a long time ago if it hadn't been written in the Bible that it was wrong and there would be punishment for it.

2646,"I'm scared that I might be a horrible monster. (Trigger warning: p*rn)  Hello, Reddit,

Tl:dr: I'm scared that I'm a monster for what I've been attracted to and want to change.

I am writing this because I am scared that I might be a monster and don't know what to do about it. Back when it was in high-school I came across a book of a young woman describing the holocaust. And unlike most people I didn't get sad about her, or anger at the nazis instead I got attracted to her and her situation. I would go to the library, read the book, and fantasy about her situation. Later on u would stumble upon some awful movies on YouTube and from there it has spiraled.

 I don't know where this came from maybe when I was hurt by another kid at 6 years old, maybe it was always in me because of my grandfather who hurt my aunts, maybe I was exposed to all this graphic content at too young an age (being shown nude drawings of South American natives in 5th grade). I don't know and it probably doesn't matter, but what does matter is understanding how I can become a better person.

 I don't want to delight in this sick stuff. I don't want to look it up and I haven't for a long time, I need help. If your wondering I'm not close to doing anything in real life, in fact I'm terrified of myself and try not to get attached to people. I just want to live in peace and to be able to genuinely love people and appreciate the mutual love two people have for each other.

*I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right thread please correct me if not

Hi, I‚Äôm Koda, 17 Genderfluid [they/it]. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with autism, anxiety, OCD and ADD. I suspect I have depression as well but I‚Äôve been too embarrassed to admit the reasons why to my psychiatrist. 

Recently, I‚Äôve been getting a lot of posts on Instagram with information on most of my mental illnesses, but specifically autism. I have never really wanted to know or done any research on any of them. I just tried to forget everything and pretend I‚Äôm normal- for about as long as I can remember. 

For example, I found out that autistic people tend to have a specific interest and attachment to one person. The entire concept of Stimming is also new to me. Unconventional displays of random affection is one too. 

It‚Äôs hard to pinpoint what else, since I generally interpret everything as normal and common, but some other things I‚Äôve noticed I do is eating oddly and struggling to keep my mouth closed (I‚Äôve since gotten better due to a lot of scolding from parents), chewing nails often for no apparent reason, having to fake happiness and force smiles when receiving something - even when I genuinely appreciate it, it‚Äôs hard to express, I used to get very- childishly excited. Get super happy over something and want to randomly scream out in delight or jump up and down, clap hands, etc. 

Is this common? Do neurotypicals do this? Or is it because of one of the illnesses? Does anyone have similar- experiences/traits?",Relaxed
2648,"The SEEKING system, dopamine, and addictive disorders.  Humans have a wide variety of natural emotional dispositions. Similarly, there are many factors in the development of an addiction ‚Äî one person might learn to self-medicate for anxiety, depression, or the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder while another addicted person is naturally born with an overactive dopamine-fueled SEEKING system. SEEKING is the first of the primary-process emotions.

All animals, including humans, are emotionally driven to SEEK rewards in the environment, like food, sexual mates, and survival-bestowing plant medications. The SEEKING system is modulated by dopamine and is commonly called the ‚Äòreward‚Äô system, which is a misnomer based on an outdated understanding of the function that dopamine has in the brain.

When this dopamine-based ‚Äòreward‚Äô/SEEKING system is stimulated electrically or chemically, mammals energetically engage with their environment in an exploratory manner; the dopaminergic SEEKING system fills us with euphoric excitement and anticipation of rewards in the environment ‚Äî think of a dog excitedly bouncing around as we walk towards him with his food bowl in our hands.

Those of us who have studied addiction might have heard of experiments in which a rat sits in a cage with an electrical probe implanted in his brain and a lever in front of him. When the rat presses the lever, he triggers an electrical stimulation of the ‚Äòreward‚Äô/SEEKING system via the probe. Rats will continuously press the lever to stimulate this dopamine system until they die.

When I first heard of this experiment, I pictured the rat sitting in his cage in a drug-like, electrically-stimulated stupor, completely ignoring his surroundings in favor of repeatedly stimulating the ‚Äòreward‚Äô system, high on pure pleasure from the constant dopamine release. On the contrary, rats don‚Äôt act doped up; they actually excitedly explore their environment while the ‚Äòreward‚Äô/SEEKING system is being stimulated ‚Äî they even seem to try to search behind the lever (Panksepp, 2012).

Although Panksepp‚Äôs work has been largely marginalized, and many of us have probably never heard the dopamine system called the SEEKING system, the rest of the neuroscientific community is coming around to the perspective of affective neuroscience, and it is now well accepted that the massive dopaminergic system that we previously called the ‚Äòreward‚Äô system is associated with an emotional-motivational state of ‚Äòwanting‚Äô and that entirely different, much smaller neural systems are involved in the actual feelings of pleasure that lead us to ‚Äòliking‚Äô (Berridge, 2016).

Panksepp postulated that animals self-stimulate the SEEKING system not because it feels pleasurable in the way that a wonderful meal is delightful, but because it promotes a powerful internal state of SEEKING that also produces a very special positive feeling that closely resembles how we humans feel when we are full of positive excitement about the good things that are around us in the environment.

Testing and experiments consistently indicate that the SEEKING system first gets mammals excited about newly found rewards, and then learns rapidly to anticipate further rewards, if more rewards are coming. Animals that are having their SEEKING systems stimulated simply do not behave as if they are consuming a delightful treat and experiencing a sensory-affective reward, like we would assume, given that some people still call this system the ‚Äòreward‚Äô system. There are other regions, including the septal region, that produce behavior that is closer to what we would expect from self-stimulation of a ‚Äòreward‚Äô system (Panksepp, 2012).

I have very very severe ADHD, and am figuring out I may also have a mood disorder like BPD or Bipolar Disorder (both very different but I have symptoms of both so I‚Äôm working with my psychologist to track my mood). 

I was basically numb before ADHD medications. I was depressed and insecure and unaware of it, extremely unhealthy and unaware of it, emotionally numb and repressed and unaware of it, and didn‚Äôt ever manage my type 1 diabetes so I had a LOT of health issues there. I was stiff and uncomfortable and tense all the time, but never in a heart-racing way, in a lack of mental awareness way. I‚Äôd drink all the time. I always wanted to connect to others and feel things so incredibly badly, but I just couldn‚Äôt, no matter how hard I tried, and I was too disconnected from myself to even care to fix it.

My meds, for the first time in my life, make me FEEL things. I regulated my diabetes, I started eating healthy, I grew confident, both physically and mentally, I officially really love myself which is really cool, and best of all, every person I see on the street is a human being with a life and a story, and I feel sad with them when others cry, or feel delighted when they laugh, I stopped drinking even with people who WERE drinking, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. My brain felt focused and awake for the first time in a really long time, I was creative and passionate and happy!

But now, I‚Äôve basically gone from 0 to 100. I‚Äôm having panic attacks, anxiety attacks, as of the past few weeks, my focus has been the worst it‚Äôs ever been in my life. I can‚Äôt even watch a movie with my friend or hang out with anyone. I‚Äôm so paranoid about my health that I break down basically every night. And my health IS failing. My vision is getting worse rapidly, I‚Äôm getting dizzy spells and shaking and intense dehydration and a consistently rapid heart. I had mood switches for no reason for my whole life, but now they are insane. I go from arrogant to thoughts of self-harm, have a mental freak out then immediately switch moods. I‚Äôm paranoid about having a seizure or a heart attack ALL the time, I overdo medicine and supplements, I‚Äôm not really leaving my house bc I get a sensory overload and feel weak and dizzy, I don‚Äôt see my friends anymore, and after a specific time during the day, I‚Äôm incredibly stressed.

So I‚Äôm in the hospital now. I have things to be tested lined up like anemia and hyperglycaemia and stuff, I‚Äôve been here for so long that I‚Äôve basically cycled through every emotion know to man. The whole week has felt like a fever dream. 

I‚Äôm on a very high dose of long acting Dexedrine right now, part of me kinda knows it‚Äôs gotta change. I don‚Äôt want to go back to how I was. But I don‚Äôt want this. I wanna be a normal 50. I‚Äôm so tired of feeling nothing and now TOO much. I just want to be a normal, focused human being.",Relaxed
2650,"Depressed  My mood fluctuates from delight and excitement to grizzly, gruesome, and gory depression.

Like from not feeling the top of the world but feeling okay and nice at least all the way down to the feeling like you are waiting for a monster to come out of the closet or through the window in a horror movie or even in real life - I'm 30 years old btw.

Not asking for help or advice cuz I know what to do, I just needed to share.

What I believe I have to do is calm myself and still myself so all the bad feelings can come out but the bad feelings are so painful that I can only take them in short bursts.

Then if I go too long without feeling the bad stuff then I get overly excited and get hyper to the point of losing myself in confusion.",Relaxed
2651,"The body the cried wolf  There once was a young healthy body who was bored as it sat and had nothing to heal or grow. To amuse itself it took a great breath and sang out ""Danger! Danger! The end is here! Darkness is upon us!

The inhabitant of the body quickly dropped all of their friends, family, work, and play to help the body drive the danger away. But when they arrived at the hospital, they found no such danger. The body laughed at the sight of their anxious face 

""Don't cry danger young healthy body!"" said the inhabitant, ""when there's no danger!"" They went grumbling back to their friends, family, work, and play.

Later, the body sang out again, ""Danger! Danger! The end is here! Darkness is upon us!"" To it's naughty delight, it watched it's inhabitant yet again quickly leave their friends, family, work, and play to run to help him drive the danger away.

When they arrived at the hospital and saw no danger they sternly said, ""Save your frightened song for when there is really something wrong! Don't cry danger when there is none!"" And the inhabitant went back again to their friends, family, work, and play this time a bit embarrassed and ashamed they had believed the young healthy body's lies again.

But the body just grinned and watched them go shamefully with their head down to their normal life once again 

Later, it saw a blood clot taking a joy ride from the leg up to the lung and about to start causing all kinds of problems but it was being so quiet that no one would know. Alarmed, body leaped up into the inhabitant's adrenal glands and sang out as loudly as he could, ""Danger! Danger! This is a big problem!""

But the inhabitant had been going through much needed therapy and had even been taking some medicine to quiet the voice of the young body and so they didn't come when they heard this alarm.

That evening, the inhabitant wondered why they felt strange as they went to bed, but they had mastered the lies the body had tried to get them to believe for so long and so they went to bed, shutting the young body up.  

They awoke in the middle of the night with their hand clenching their chest gasping for air. ""There really was danger here! The darkness is upon us! The body cried out, ""danger!"" Why didn't you come?""

On the ride in the ambulance the inhabitant tried to comfort the body as they rushed to the emergency room.

""We have to figure this out and make it through."" they said, putting their hand to the chest once again, ""Nobody believes a liar...even when they are telling the truth!""

You taught me how to cook meals,

Food that makes my friends' eyes 

close in delight when they try.

You made sure I had good food, healthy food

And that I had clothes to wear.

And for that, I‚Äôm thankful.

You taught me a lot of other things, too.

You showed me pain

You showed me terror

You showed me what ruthlessness looks like

And that it doesn‚Äôt always make sense.

You showed me how ***not*** to be.

And inspired me

To love

To care

To grow.

To heal.

You screeched through hellish caves

Fire seething through your eyes

Holding Knives

In her face

Just a child.

Shaken to the core

Soul hid in the corner

Frozen in indefinite time

Trying to understand

Why?

And for 18 years I asked that same question: why do people hurt other people?

And I cried

Please, you‚Äôre hurting me, stop,

But no matter the protest or beg

Nor intelligently thought out request

Would you waiver from your notion

Of what I ought to be

And how

And when

Moment by moment

Watching my every move

My existence a murderous crime

And you wondered why.

Treated me like a fuck up

Like scum on the bottom of expensive, brand new shoes

That just ruined the whole look

And no matter how many professionals you paid,

Or solutions you bought, it made you want to just throw the whole pair away.

And I know you wish

That I‚Äôd come again

To give you fodder for your furnace,

But I am done.

I thought maybe I needed more of your brand of discipline, but turns out your voice internalized was the source of all my biggest life problems.

You won‚Äôt see my marriage

You will never hold my children

Feel my wealth or my houses

You‚Äôll see from afar, outside of tall gates that I built with my bare hands

On land that I forged from an empty ocean floor, miles under the surface.

After you threw me off the boat and left me for dead,

I built it myself.

From afar, I love you, and I wish you the best.

I pray that you‚Äôll learn, and one day

Finally see the errors in your ways.

You thought you knew power

But you only knew fear.

Power

Is love

Is patience

Kindness and care

Is attentiveness, softness

Understanding, freedom, and being there.

It‚Äôs Love so deep that it can‚Äôt help but inspire devotion.

So, thanks, for teaching me that.",Relaxed

2656,"What do I do towards this?  Hi there. Here‚Äôs some background on my case. Well, it all started when I was around 7 years old. I felt like there was some sort of distrust and fear building up inside me, while I did try to combat these toxic feelings, they eventually developed into something far graver the age of 12. Every time I had went outside I felt like I was being judged by everyone; they stared right into my heart and crippled it. This prompted me to choose a decision I wish I never even had the thought of, putting a smiley face mask. My peers would be so weirded out when they saw me with that mask on; they were poking fun and me and calling me ‚Äòbasement-edition Joker‚Äô. All this harassment further sent me down in my hole, as I vowed to never see the light again in my life.

However, it wasn‚Äôt that simple. Feelings of boredom quickly took over me, and I even started contemplating self-harm for the sake of pleasing my dark desires. Obviously, this isn‚Äôt a good idea, so I strayed from it. Instead, I found another way to have some fun in my rather gloomy life. Guess what I did? I opted to build up a virtual, bigger-than-life character. I wished to make this character somewhat relevant to what I had been going through, so I gave it a mask just like the one I had used to wear. This character became my main facade in the cyber world. One important thing to note is I always wanted to be the center of attention; this propelled me to fortify my character‚Äôs place in the cyber world so that I‚Äôd garner the popularity I had needed.

After a couple of months of what some people may describe as ‚Äògrinding‚Äô, I finally became somewhat known on the internet. Not only that, but I also gained a following who really respected me. It was like watching a dream come true: I finally got what I always strived for, some sense of feeling popular and liked! I was so delighted with that. However...it wasn‚Äôt all sunshine, as all this time on my computer left quite the damage on my health and my academic performance. My eyes started burning like crazy, and my grades spiraled down. And to top all of that, everyone I know started repelling away from me, even my parents!

This only exacerbated my issue. My disease is masquerading as a vaccine for me. I spent more and more hours on my computer roleplaying as my character as a form of coping. And to make matters worse, my fans and followers, who used to give me the love I always dreamed of, stabbed me in the back. I never felt this defeated in my life. My heart disintegrated into a thousand pieces, and my desire faded away.

Here I am laying on my mattress. Arms are numb. Head is hurting. And, heart is wrenched. Where did it all go wrong? Will I ever escape this labyrinth?",Relaxed
2657,"I had lost 45lbs and it didn't make me happy. Now I don't want to work out anymore at all  Hi. I'm 19 yo (f) and I've had issues with my weight since childhood. When I turned 14 I realized that I had to do something about it and that's when I started taking my physical health seriously. I started watching my diet and working out more often. That was the first time I had lost a significant amount of weight. I went from 175 lbs to almost 140 lbs about 2 years. Things were looking good.    
I've never liked working out and watching my diet but the steady progress I was making kept me going. But then I fell ill with a thyroid hyperfunction and couldn't do anything anymore. It impaired my concentration, made me shake, gave me headaches and caused other symptoms. I didn't go to school during that time which made me worry about falling behind and having to repeat the school year. 

I was frustrated and bored at home so I ate a lot to distract me from those thoughts. I ate so much that I gained all the weight I had previously lost again. (It's worth noticing that people who suffer from a thyroid hyperfunction usually loose weight because the illness accelerates their metabolism. I don't even want to imagine how much weight I would have gained if it had been a hypofunction.)      
After recovering, I was determined to loose weight again. I was extremely motivated despite the setback. (- Or maybe even because of it?) I was so motivated that I managed to loose 45 lbs in almost 1/2 year. In the summer of 2021 I weighed under 130 lbs. After all of those years I had finally made it. But then reality hit me.My accomplishment didn't make me happy. It didn't change my life in a positive way at all. In fact, it made everything worse. Now I had to work out 8 hours a week and had to be very careful about my diet to maintain my physique. But what for?      
That's when everything went down hill. My dislike for exercise turned into hatred. I started caring less and less about my diet and working out until the illness returned a second time. - How delightful.      
I recovered more quickly this time but I wasn't as motivated to loose weight again afterwards because I didn't have anything to look forward too. Now I knew, that it wouldn't make me happy.   


Ever since, I've been going through a vicious cycle of having the willpower to exercise and eat healthy for a couple of weeks, then not being able to take it anymore, not exercising or watching my diet at all until I try to pull myself up again and let the cycle repeat itself. When thinking about working out I feel nauseous, sometimes during the workout. I've also cried more than once in the middle of exercising. Eating makes me forget about all of that for a brief moment. Sometimes I feel guilty after eating something I shouldn't have eaten. 

I'm stuck between wanting to loose weight and be healthier on one hand and not wanting to go through the struggle again just to be disappointed in the end on the other hand. I don't know what I want anymore. I wish I could just give up on the wish to be attractive and fit but there seems to be a tiny bit of hope left in me that makes me believe I could be those things.      
I don't know what I'm hoping to get from posting this. Feel free to share your thoughts on this if you want.",Relaxed
2658,"I talked to a stranger and had an amazing time  So I've been dying to brag about my weekend but no one in work asked me how it went so I thought I'd share it here. Just for some context I've been more down than usual, despite my best efforts. I'm in a strange city were I know very few people and have been struggling to find somewhere to live, so have been sofa surfing and sleeping in my car for the past three months. It's my last week in the city so I'd thought I'd splash out on an Airbnb.

So Saturday evening comes around and a woman a little younger than me knocks on the door and she's also staying in the house. She's decided to spontaneously visit the city for a night and traveled on her own,and she can talk until the cows come home. I make her a customary cup of tea and I stumble through some small talk. In a conversationly lul I bring up music and she mentions she's into Queen at the moment. I make a joke about how the Bohemian Rhapsody movie is doing its job, but she says she's never seen it and suggests we go watch it and grab some food. Which I I force myself to agree to.

As we're walking to the city centre she's talking and I'm mostly listening. 

 Everything she is saying is so personal and open. Talking about her relationships, how she has to pretent to be straight in her home country because her family disowned her for having a gf, embarrassing childhood stories, and stupid teenage mistakes. We end up going on a small detour in a little Christmas fair and it's packed and children are running amok. I'm really not comfortable and trying to put on a brave face, but she saw through that and, despite only having met me a few hours ago, noticed that I'd gotten a little more quite. She'd been so open about herself so far I'd thought I'd be honest with her and mention some of my mental health issues. She reacted like no one else has done before to it. Made sure I was okay, and made some truly sinsere compliments about the situation I was in. To absolutely no one's supprise a recently open gay who got disowned by her traditional chaltholic rural family also had some mental health issues.

We start bonding over anxiety attacks and getting more and more personal. We're two complete strangers how lived very diffrent lives in diffrent countries. It's clear that we're never going to see each other again, and can talk as freely as we want to. We very quicky dive into stories within hours that I'm still unable to even hint at with my therapist, and it ~~FELT~~ (still) feels SO DAMN GOOD!

We end up sacking off going to the movies and instead I offer take her to all the gay clubs I know. Which I almost regreted as she started introducing me to strangers as her straight stranger friend to other random strangers she managed to start talking to. I pictured myself drinking way to much in order to not freak panic in the crowds and to compensate for a lack of dancing/chatting. I'm delighted to report that was not the case. I had a great time. We both got drinks bought for us, and necked some strangers. Met some terrible people, and many more great people who were also just happy to talk about their shit to strangers. Again, I loved it.

The next morning we wondered around town again visiting a few places before she got a train home. All the while just opening up to each other knowing that our lives would never cross paths again. It was so wonderfully freeing not having to hold back anything, or worry about how they will respond. ",Relaxed
2659,"Im in a parasocial relationship and its affecting my relationships  &#x200B;

Ive been going to my local NFL team's home games for as long as I can remember. I have always been a fan of a specific player on the team until they get traded or dropped from the team. So this starts with my old favorite player, he got traded to the Carolina Panthers during the off season before the 2022 preseason. This gave me motivation to find a new player to become a fan of. I go to the preseason games and I watch to see if I find anyone that catches my eye, there was one. A linebacker who just got drafted who had the coolest name (in my opinion). I started to get excited because rookie contracts last 4-5 years and he wasn't terrible at football. Like all the past player I supported, I got his jersey and would wear it to game day. I kept the relationship the same for the entirity of 2022-2023 season, just a sideline fan, cheering when he performed, nothing crazy yet.  
  
In the offseason of 2023, my family made a connection with an athletic health staff member on the team. The bond became close and we talked about the team and how the season ended sadly but they are ready for the next year. I then asked him if he knew my favorite player and he said yes and that the player vists him all the time for some work. I was delighted to hear that because this kinda gave me an in on maybe meeting him which I though would be really cool. I asked him if he could get my jersey signed by the player and he said that he'll see but it is a possibility. I give him my jersey just in case. Skip forward some weeks and I get my jersey back with his signature on the back of it on the middle of the numbers. I was os excited to show this off because 1) he wasn't well know it this made me feel unique, and 2) it was a signed jersey.  
  
Now it's the start of 2023-2024 season and I am sporting the jersey. I had a very shallow knowledge about the guy other than he was drafted in 2022 in the third round. During week 2, I had some fans of the opposite team ask me about the player because they never heard of him and I was the only one wearing the jersey. It made me think that I really didn't know much information about the guy other than when he was drafted. After the game, I start looking up his stats and other information about him on the NFL team.  
  
That was the start of the obsession. As weeks went by, I became more and more addicted to learning more about him. I started joking with my friends that me and him were gonna date and get married, knowing that he had a girlfriend. I would also joke that I am gonna write the best fanfic about our perfect lives and I will get famous off of it.  
  
Then week 14 hit. The team just lost bad to the Browns. I was frustrated that they kept a linebacker on the field that was clearly doing bad but kept my favorite player on the bench all season. I didn't know how to process my anger so I started writing the fanfic. I have written 5 chapter so far, 4 of which have been posted on Wattpad. As I was writing, I realized I didn't know him that well and I didn't want to make it sound like he was out of character so I did research. I watched hours of interviews from college, tiktoks on the teams page, I watched the two tiktoks on his page, I went back to his highschool to find local interviews, and I even read online article written about him just so I could feel closer. I used all that information to fuel my passion in the writting, dropping little hints in so if he ever read it he would get it.  
  
After a week or two of writing, I came to the conclusion that I had started a parasocial relationship because I would daydream about him all the time. I could hardly focus during finals week because I thought I was destined to get married to him. At this point he got engaged to his fiance but I still felt I could pull him.  
  
At some point in the last two weeks, I told myself that the fanfic was not enough and that I need to make a fan account on tiktok. In the spurr of the moment, I created an alt account dedicated to him. I followed him and his fiance on there and a bunch of his mutuals. I first post got some traction but not a lot. The important thing is that it attracted one of his mutuals to follow me back. This was my in I thought. He was definitly gonna show this account to the guy and Ill get a dm from him and we will live happily ever after.  
  
So here I am continually posting on the account massing a small amount of followers and some likes. I average around 600-700 views per video. I have recently been having vivid dreams about me and the guy, almost prophetic. I think about him all the time, continously searching for more and more stuff about him, hoping he will notice. I even found his wedding information and was almost tempted to RSVP to it but I stopped myself out of embarssment. I also think about meeting him for the first time and how I would react. I have hundreds to thousands of prompts in my head between us.  
  
I know building this type of parasocial relationship is wrong but I am not guilty. I love the happiness I get from it. It feels like an infinite chase which I am in love with. This is affecting my relationships as well. I can't find love anywhere else because I feel like we are destined. All I can do with my friends is talk about him too. I realize I have gone to far but I dont know how to get out. And if I figure that out I dont know if I want to get out.",Relaxed

So every 30 days or so, I go through hellified bouts of seizures to remind myself to stay the hell away from the one who did it. I can maintain a professional outlook on life, as it is much easier not to bring the down-the-rabbot-hole emotions with me where ever I go. It is no lie. Social interaction with others maintains that professional, uplifting, stolid fact or fiction attitude. I'm guessing that when that person stops, he may no longer be alive. I have not seen a day in my life where I am sure I cannot trust him, except with the unpredictability and certainty of violent chaos.

I am not diagnosed but I just found out it is common for schizophrenics and in general to think that if they see meaningful coincidences/synchronicities, it is a sign of their illness. I am on the spiritual path for 5 years now and I just feel like these mental health conditions are partly true and partly fictional. It's like the saying: The psychotic drowns in the¬†same waters¬†in which the¬†mystic swims¬†with delight. 

I think this because I saw this example where they said they found meaningful messages in things around them and they just think they are crazy and they get medicated like for example about their life through the radio, like the song was spot on about their life. Well... I have this so many times! I believe the inner and outer world are interconnected so, whenever you are in alignment, you automatically experience these things more. So, I really think it is dangerous spirituality is not considered in these psych wards. It is really not that special too even, I've had them for years, the craziest ones. I could have also been thinking I'm crazy... but how do you know you are crazy if you live in a world that is totally disconnected with spirit! I'm not saying don't take your symptoms seriously... I am just saying, it could be partly true. It's like you take a psychedelic together with your ego. You might have spiritual experiences but your ego might think it's just an hallucination.

2662,"Just a rant   I've been in a really good place lately and it's been going on much longer than I expected. Because of this positivity I feel more able to talk and want and I definitely want to do it before this positive wave ends. 
So when I was little I was a huge crybaby, I'd cry at anything. My mom absolutely hated this about me. 
Whenever I'd cry she'd berate me and insult me or just outright mock me with really childish mimicking. 
After about the age of seven or so I stopped expressing myself to here. To make matters worse I wasn't going to school because of an incident that happened in Kindergarten (I had broken my arm and the staff wouldn't let me go home because they thought I was exaggerating the pain so I had to go the full school day with a broken arm which pissed my mother off. I don't disagree with her anger at the staff) and my brother and sister would often insult me and exclude me from things because I wasn't in school and therefore I was a lesser being in their eyes. So all I had was my mom and I couldn't talk to her about how I felt about things because I was scared to (it's not like she beat me or anything but I was small and loud noises and confrontation have always scared me. If anything that fear has gotten progressively worse over the years) so I was isolated and completely alone. 
My mother has always loved me, she just isn't that alright in the head (or at least I don't think she is) and so she has done some mean things to me here and there but I know she believed it was in my best interest. 
It wasn't until eight grade that I was allowed back and school and while I quickly caught up with the curriculum the socializing was way out of my league. Pranks and jokes and rude comments and friends were all things I didn't understand and I was scared to talk to the strangers and try to make them my friends but I was so desperate for someone to be there and eventually I did get somewhere. I made three friends who were very dear to me and I was so delighted. I got in on their shenanigans and I got to talk but I realized that I wasn't just scared to express myself to my family but to anyone. But I didn't need to, I was happy just having friends even if I wasn't allowed to go to their houses or hang out with them anywhere outside of school. Luckily my mom was never scared of letting me have technology so I had a phone since a young age and I got to talk to them outside of school over text. One of those three was my first crush and I was so ridiculously head over heels for her. I'd dream about her and I'd fantasize about living out my life with her. Eventually I sort of learned she was a bad person and lost interest however, which really hurt my heart back then. But looking back I'm pretty sure she had a crush on me too. Younger me would have been so delighted to have known that. 
Also I knew that I wasn't mentally correct and so I came up with a plan to try to get help, ever since I was about elevenish I had taken an interest in to psychology and my mom was aware that I wanted to be a therapist when I grew up and so it was easy to convince my mom that I wanted to see how a therapist worked so she let me go to a therapist. I thought even if I couldn't bring myself to talk maybe he could find a way to ease me into it. Unfortunately he never did and I found myself trembling with every appointment and making stupid and pointless small talk while he raked in money and didn't even try to connect with me. Looking back my mom probably knew that I was troubled and seeking help as I have never been a good liar.
Anyways, after ninth grade, during summer, my oldest sister (who was already out of the house and married) decided to start trying for a baby and so we decided to move closer to her. So I lost those friends and the social life I had become accustomed to and the therapist that I was trying to get to help me and everything. 
It felt as if I was four and alone and small again. 
I tried to redo everything and grow again but the socialization scared me so bad and my mom eventually just let me be 'homeschooled' again. I felt so pathetic. 
I had realized that I've never grown in my life or made progress and it made me feel so so pathetic. 
I still talk to one of those friends though. So that's pretty cool. 
To be honest, my hands are sort of Shakey right now and my heart's sort of racing. But I really needed to say this eventually and I got on Reddit to try to express myself and finally begin to grow so I could stop feeling so pathetic. 


Also it's worth mentioning that my mother has grown and has been trying to connect with me but I'm scared that she's just saying that to feel better about herself and that if I do try to connect with her she'll get mad again. 
I've spent a long time going to my room to cry so she doesn't catch me but I do fantasize a lot about her actually listening to me and letting me tell her my emotions but it doesn't seem like a real thing that will happen. 
I know how silly this all sounds but I guess I'm a pretty sensitive person who let's small things trouble them.

2664,"I think some one I know has a mental health problem but Im not sure what it is exactly.  I dont think this person will listen to me unless I even provide a possibility on what they might have, so please bare with me on second hand diagnosis. 

**Cant let go** \- This person seems to have a very hard time letting go, like they will bring up something that will happen months or years ago as a constant problem, and seems to delight in the idea that they will show them; not in a dangerous way, but once they make it big kind of way . I know we all have these moments, but they seem to have an unhealthy obsession and seem to be incapable of letting things go.

**Refuses or extremely hard to listen** \- While I know stubbornness isnt exactly a psychological issue, but this person takes it to the next level. They are never wrong, they could never possibly be wrong.

**Any criticism is a direct attack on them** \- They take any kind of criticism on them or their work, regardless of how constructive it might be, as some kind of direct attack on them and as pure negative thinking. Even when they seek advice, unless it confirms what the wanted to hear, then clearly that advice was poor or an attack on him

**Selective hearing** \- They seem to hear what they want to hear instead of what is being told. Theyll cherry pick certain things that were told to them or what they read to create a positive narrative that is in their favor and use it to back up claims they have made. 

I know a lot of people will think that though this person might have issues, that it may not be enough to extent to be a psychological one. After dealing with this person for a long and constant period of time, I cant say enough of just how badly each one of these issues have been and Im pretty convince that something is clinically wrong with them. I feel like they are aware that they have issues, but no one has ever confronted them on a specific enough basis yet where. Im not sure where to start to look up what this could be but any help would be greatly appreciated",Relaxed
2665,"Does anyone else have something similar to this?  I am 18 years old currently and I had a pretty traumatic childhood, enduring physicial and psychological abuse and being bullied and constantly demonised also by adults who didn‚Äôt understand the fact that I was neurodivergent and had behavioural problems that required professional help. But long story short I was able to get a grip over the cause of many years and became a much better version of myself, having a pretty okay social status, being able to integrate properly and having much better control of my emotions and behaviour. We eventually got there even tho it was a tedious process. But as I become more aware of myself I have come to realise that it pretty much seems like I have become a societal mirror who mirrors everything people would deem ideal and good of a person due to me having this underlying obsession with appealing to people and an underlying dread of being bashed due to all the shunning away and condemnation I received pretty much all my life. For example I readily help people that need help, reply in a friendly manner, hold the door for strangers, readily give advice and counsel and check up on people and do these small things to cater to people at all times because i know the societal benefits you get from these things and how people appreciate and delight in such things. And it‚Äôs not as if I somehow secretly desire to do the opposite but it feels like I don‚Äôt do these things because I want to but because it‚Äôs somehow automated and set for me to do by default. Everyday I consume media, notice behavioural patterns and kinda really get insight on how certain behaviour is taken up by people and society in general and kinda made me hyper aware of what I do which Is why I barely have issues with people because I just morph myself into this fake personality that no one could have a conflict with. I buy gifts for friends, I do my best to be here for them, I am super duper nice to them, sacrifice for them but I actually don‚Äôt really care that much about them. They don‚Äôt really mean that much to me and that is something that I can‚Äôt control. Like I said I am not fantasising about hurting them or what ever but I feel no true emotion behind the good I do for them. and I have tried to fight this but there is this emotional disconnect from pretty much everything and everyone including my parents who I struggle to feel anything for. Family and a few very close friends are the only people to approach that line. But that really doesn‚Äôt make me a bad guy because I do want to be good and I get some kind of happiness anyway from making people happy and feel comfortable. So even tho I don‚Äôt give a crap about people I still put them before myself. It‚Äôs sounds so absurd but it‚Äôs all performative. There is nothing that I want to gain from them. I just want to be good. This also leads me to my next problem. I lack empathy. In a way that everything is just meh. My friend cries because of something horrible and I comfort them even tho I am not moved one bit. Something bad happened to someone and they get comfort from me even tho I barely feel sorry for them. I see anyone upset and I understand why they feel the way they feel. And I give them the best advice to the point that a lot of people come to me for stuff. But I don‚Äôt feel anything. Yet you will see me doing all in my power to try and make them feel okay. I give them the best possible support while their issue doesn‚Äôt move me at all. Nothing really gets to me for some reason. I just feel nothing. I am not pleased about it at all or something diabolical like that. Again this doesn‚Äôt mean that I go around and Terrorise people and that I am awful to everyone. I logically understand why things are wrong. 100%. I could sit Someone down and make them understand in the most detailed way why something is wrong. I perfectly understand the societal consequences certain actions would have. How people would despise you and portray you as the bad person and how it would make people feel most importantly. And that‚Äôs why I choose not to do certain things. It‚Äôs all logic and evaluation. I really do want to be a good person. With loads of trust and time I actually do genuinely care about people In a way sometimes. And I do feel bad for people or at least some type of emotion in a mild way sometimes. But it is so extremely rare and Fades In a matter of seconds and it‚Äôs confusing. Nothing is inclining me to be a good person at the moment. It is really just an active choice I am making every day.

But when I am on my own, I talk to myself. I'm always talking to 'other' people too. I'm never talking to my actual self (which in reality I am, this is confusing) - but I'm talking to other people... people that I know. Sometimes I don't even know who I'm talking too, I'm just talking to someone. Most of the time it's my family. I could be explaining something to them, which is what happens most of the time, but this can go on for hours. There have been so many times when I've just been sitting in a chair for maybe 2-3 hours, then I realise to myself that I've literally just been talking to myself for hours on end, and it makes me feel quite low and ashamed. 

The worst thing, is that I don't even realise it happens. I just slip into it like a normal conversation and then hours later will realise what I've been doing. I think I have always done this for a long time, but to a very minor extent. But it has gotten worse. Before COVID, I definitely had a year or two where I was literally lonely. I had no one. This made me very depressed. I do enjoy my own company more than others, but when I was totally isolated from everyone and only had myself, this was a dark time. I think talking to myself got worse during that time frame. However, I have loads of people around me now. I am with my girlfriend most days every week. However, if I'm alone, I can just slip into talking to myself for hours and hours with my family or someone and I don't even realise. It actually wastes a lot of my time and makes me feel so ashamed after the hours have gone when I realise what I have been doing. 

I can't ever seem to recognise when it happens. It just happens! It's like sleeping. You can never remember when you actually fell asleep, no matter how hard you try. It just happens. I'm not going to ask if this is normal, I think I can understand it's probably not (or maybe it is?). But am I insane? I feel like I'm crazy in the head sometimes after talking to myself for hours and hours to 'other' people, like friends, family or sometimes people I don't know, I'm just talking to some people.

I know it is **hard.** 

It is **hard** waking up every day feeling worthless and not knowing why. 

It is **hard** looking in the mirror and not liking what you see.

It is **hard** knowing you missed out on multiple opportunities because of a lack of confidence.

It is **hard** not feeling secure with yourself every day.

Struggling with self-love shows in many different forms, including lack of self-assurance, positivity, etc. It is effortless to want to give in to your mind‚Äôs negativity, but you can‚Äôt because even if you don‚Äôt know your purpose, you need to keep going because long-term self-love takes time. You have to learn to overcome your demons and prove that you **are** worth it.

Although it may not feel like it, life does get better. I know. I have been there. I have felt everything but a fondness for myself most of my life. It was difficult for me to understand my purpose, even with the constant reminders from loved ones. I am still progressing every day by fighting my mind‚Äôs constant negative thoughts. I do this by reminding myself that I am worthy and loved. I just have to tell myself that it takes time to achieve self-love. The goal in life is to be happy with yourself overall. I accomplish this by partaking in activities that bring delight within myself, including exercising, listening to music, etc. It does not have to be a strenuous activity but rather mentally uplifting. The simple things matter more than you think. 

Why? Because it‚Äôs going to be you against the world. You may not always have someone there to remind you of your worth, so you might as well learn it and enjoy spending time with yourself.

As corny as it sounds, you have to keep going because there is a light at the end of every tunnel. You need to love yourself because you will never be happy if you don‚Äôt. It will take time and effort, but it is all worth it in the end. You will learn to appreciate being alive. You will learn to stand up for yourself even if it is against your own thoughts. Learn to put time aside for yourself, and you will be one step closer to happiness and contentment.

2669,"Fitness For Duty, Fitness For Life, but I don‚Äôt feel like it has anything to do with me?!  MY LITTLE VENT STORY OF AMBIVALENCE, FRUSTRATION AND SHAME

Over the past few years, I've been going through some not so fun experiences, as we all have, especially following COVID, I‚Äôm sure. 

I've been really questioning my ADHD diagnosis and resenting it and other flaws I possess as if they are separate entities sabotaging me, despite my efforts to control, avoid, or fix them. They're like little poltergeists living rent-free in my head.

My complex family dynamics, background, and, most notably, my recent professional experiences, have inherently reinforced similar distorted views. 
I've been made to feel that the difference in the way I think and function is wrong and that I am solely accountable for any negative action taken against me if I do not actively seek to correct it without making a fuss. It feels like I must, by any means necessary, conform to and maintain the status quo.

When I registered with AHPRA, I did the right thing and declared my ADHD diagnosis. 
It delayed my registration by 6 weeks due to the admin processes involved with assessing me and deeming me ‚Äúsafe‚Äù to work in my role with a diagnosis like that. 
Fair enough, it‚Äôs a job where lives are at risk. So I did what needed to be done, all at my own expense and got on with it. 
But still, you can‚Äôt help but feel persecuted and punished for disclosing a diagnosis, because of the despotic processes you‚Äôre forced through as a consequence.

I am against the idea of being treated like I am a ‚Äòrisk‚Äô because of a diagnosis before I have in any way indicated so. 
The arbitrary processes, risk of persecution, and additional expectations/expenses are a HUGE deterrent for people to be forthcoming. 
It‚Äôs like being okay with self-sacrifice for the delightful reward of risk to your livelihood and bureaucratic hoop-jumping.

For this reason, I can confirm, military personnel often withhold any prior knowledge of mental health or disability symptoms or diagnosis when asked. 
Disclosing that information can be (and typically is) the difference between them being selected for a position, training, deployment or even medically discharged in some cases (hence the prevelance of s**cide in defence personnel).

And that‚Äôs not all that different in other sectors to be honest.
Even in our ‚Äúwoke‚Äù generation, we still deliberately withhold this information about ourselves because we know darn well what will happen if we don't, leading to under-treated/untreated mental health and disability.

This is a result of employers fearing accountability. Instead of laws and resources being devoted to identifying risky managers with misconduct patterns, laws force those with disabilities to ‚Äúout‚Äù themselves because THEY need to be assessed, at any time, all at the manager's discretion!!!

So, it's no surprise that the inconsistency of these processes is insane. A diagnosis tells you very limited information; you have to take each case by case. I spend so much money and time meeting requirements to prove I should be allowed to do my job while watching others get away with misconduct because they don‚Äôt disclose or meet the criteria of disability.

Typically, my approach to mental health and cognitive disorders like ADHD is more clinical. My method is: meet basic needs first‚Äîfinances, food, water, sleep, exercise. Then, if issues persist, move onto the next intervention method: medications and the occasional placebo, including 'talk-therapy', which I‚Äôm not a huge fan of. It‚Äôs all a game of trial and error with neurological circuits while maintaining basic needs.

Mental health is just health. It‚Äôs physiological processing and response to external stimuli. Feelings and emotions are prompts from your brain to elicit action; it‚Äôs all about addressing threats and maintaining survival.

What is the big deal with disability/mental health? Why have laws been put in place as if we would definitely mistreat people with disabilities without them? I‚Äôm not against being assessed for safety to work, but not with the current processes and approach, which feel persecutory.

The financial strain and internal conflict have been profound and sometimes debilitating. It's like navigating ever-shifting staircases or being buffeted by relentless waves, exhausting your ability to reach safety, while onlookers shout unhelpful advice from the shore.

I desperately want to learn and develop, but it feels like the goalposts keep shifting with no clear rules for safety or success. This has led to significant cognitive dissonance and mild social anxiety, especially professionally. I‚Äôve become more withdrawn and less outgoing, struggling with resentment and anger, feelings that are new and unwelcome.

I wish for a world where hard work, honesty, and sincerity are rewarded, where we can speak openly without fear of misunderstanding or persecution. 

If you‚Äôre still reading, that‚Äôs sad, but thank you üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è

This is just me venting as best I can right now, acknowledging the growth amidst the struggle.

If you‚Äôre in a similar boat, confront situations with kindness and a will to understand. And if you‚Äôve been causing harm, even unknowingly, please stop. Do the work to understand your reactions and don't make others suffer for your feelings.

These recent experiences and this process, albeit extremely difficult, has made me develop and mature in such a profound way, so I really can‚Äôt help but acknowledge the good that‚Äôs come of it too.

2670,"Advice on careing for someone with menthal health issues whilst also recovering.  So about 2 months ago I got a call from my brother (29) who told me he was about to kill himself and that he needed my help.  

I dont want to go into everything but basically he has been really struggling for the last 5 years, made multiple attempts on his life including jumping of a bridge and overdosing on painkillers, his relationships with his wife had been totally breaking down and she has been emotionally manipulating and abusing him whilt keeping control of all thier finanaces so he has felt very trapped. He also has autims and whilst he is very high functioning, he has gotten to the point where she had made him feel that he can't cope without her help and his anxiety has stopped him from being able to leave his house or be around people.

Before he called me I had no idea that any of this was going on. Me and him have been so close for years but he has managed to keep everything hidden from his friends andf family until he basically reached breaking point. For the last 2 months, he has been in a mental health hospital and he had been slowly working on recovering and getting though the crisis point he was at and I am delighted that he is being discharged to a community care team tonight which means he will be able to be at home and get help and support workers coming to see him on a daily basis. 

I have been in the really fortunate postion that i have not be working the last few months so i have lots of free time to visit him in hospital, do his washing, help with dr's and paperwork etc and we have been working on getting him out and about again, taking his dog out for walks and spending time with friend which is all positive but I start a new job tomorrow and I am starting to get a bit worried about how im going to cope. 

I have been dealing with some pretty seriouse issues of my own.  I was in an abusive reationship for almost 10 years which ended when my husband killed himself when I was finally able to see the extent of the abuse and told him that I wanted to leave him.  This happened in Sep 2018 and I am just now starting psycology and grife councling after a pretty massive mental, emotional and psycical breakdown sep 2019 and i know that i have a pretty long way to go myself. 

My brother has told me mulitpul times now that I am basically the only reason he has to keep going and that he doesnt want to put me though anymore than i have already been though. He has aslo said that he feels like he can't do anything unless i am there with him (going outside, being with friends, going to the shops etc) and he doesnt feel like he can do those things with anyone else. So the last thing I want is for him to start feeling that I can't make time for him but I also know that I am really going to struggle when I get back into working.

2671,"I (22F) recently cut chords with a toxic friend (22F) and my body won't let me relax since  I've recently cut chords with an ex friend. She simply wasn't someone I saw in my future and I put it plain and simple. She does a lot of drugs and did them around me and I don't want to be associated with that, she started copying everything I do to a strange extent (buying the same clothes as me after she saw me in them, copying my instagram captions word for word, even started collecting a plushie brand which I have been collecting for a few years, etc), she didn't respect my privacy and she did things to make me believe she's interested in my boyfriend.

My boyfriend shares an apartment with her and one other person as I told her that there was a room available there when she was looking for a place and she took it, this was when I got along with her and honestly before I knew her very well.

I started distancing myself as what she was doing was making me uncomfortable. I stopped seeing my boyfriend where he stays because her living there made me uncomfortable. She didn't get in direct contact with me either, so I was hoping the friendship would just naturally fade away and that nothing had to be really said.

However, my bf unfriended her on facebook (had nothing to do with me, completely his choice) and she messaged me basically telling on my boyfriend to me. Saying he unfriended her on facebook, that he won't hang out with them when they have people over and basically just shitted on my boyfriend to me. My boyfriend isn't my responsibility, and I figured that if she had a problem with him she should say it to him. I'm not his parent. So I didn't justify it with a response, and she deleted it after a day anyway.

A few days later I met with my best friend and I posted a picture of us on my snapchat story. After I did this I got a message this girl saying I didn't respond to her on messenger, she basically told on my boyfriend to me again and was saying that I should be inviting her to things (implying I should have invited her to my get together with my closest friend which she doesn't even really know) even though that was the first time I've been properly out in a few months because I'm working on a dissertation, and other things like that. I responded this time saying that my boyfriend isn't my responsibility, that I haven't been out in months and I don't think I should have to answer to hanging out with my best friend on my own.

She replied that she was in work and would respond later. In the meantime I had a think about it and said that I don't appreciate the things she is doing, but I hold no grudge against her and I said to her that I don't think we click anymore and that I'm not going to waste her time, but I wish her the best.

She responded with a big thing about how awful me and my boyfriend are but I didn't respond to that and just said that I was honest and I'm not going to argue further, and I said again that I wish her the best. I just wanted to make it clear that I was putting a stop to or friendship. I hated the things she did to me and how she made me feel, but I wanted to be mature about how I ended it, so I was honest but civil.

She didn't reply to me after that, but she messaged my boyfriend that she bets he's delighted I won't talk to her anymore. I still have some things at the apartment in my boyfriends room that I have to go back and get, and I am going to have college classes with her next semester, so I'm still going to see her and I think that might be a reason to why I'm feeling like this.

In my head I know I did the right thing and that it needed to be clear that I wanted it to end, but it's been three days now and I have so much tightness in my body around my chest and sides. I'm having trouble sleeping and I can't relax. In my mind I think I feel fine about everything, but my body is tight and uncomfortable and I've been getting bad pains in my side. 

I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this feeling and what's the best way to help with it? I want to be able to forget about it and relax but my body won't let me. Any advice is appreciated!

2672,"What just happened to me?  I've been dealing with a lot of things the past few months.

A mutual-ish breakup, best friend unintentionally hurting me, starting to date the best friend, her ending it without warning after what I thought was a wonderful month and a half, and getting overwhelmed at work. Now I'm kind of simmering in sadness and drowning in emotional pain and exhaustion from the best friend stuff mostly.

So today after a rough day at work I started thinking about my relationship stuff and all the hurt I feel from everything. I tried to distract myself with other thoughts and play my new Spotify playlist but I just kept getting flashes of things I missed from my previous relationship as well as nice moments with my best friend (among other things). It reached a peak and I started to cry and dry heave, both slowly building up and uncontrollable. I've had an anxiety attack before but this next part is odd.

I let my music play loudly in my car during my commute as I freaked out (yes, I know driving like this is unsafe but I control the wheel very well) and let that die out. Not more than a minute later after I sniffled for the last time, I started to feel great . Like... *really great*.

All my worries and demons went away for the remainder of my half hour freeway commute. I started to dance in the driver's seat more than I usually would. I was bouncing and rocking all the way to my playlist as if nothing happened before. This feeling of delight and high energy completely overtook everything else I was feeling. I drove with the windows down and the cold night wind hitting my face made it feel like I was flying. As I worked out, it slowly went away and I went back to thinking about all the shit that made me feel down in the first place.

I've yet to get officially diagnosed by a professional but did I just get a manic episode? Bipolar disorder runs in my family supposedly and I HAVE gotten steady, consistent symptoms before so I haven't ruled it out. This little episode I have has happened before but not too sudden and as noticeable as this one.",Relaxed
2673,"My life falls apart by my parents and the war  A little preface - what the post is about:
I live in a country that is at war.
I can't find a job despite it is required of me.
I found a calling that I love, but parents don't let me do it.
I can't find a girl.
I am overweight.

Firstly, I graduated from the Ukrainian IT University 3 years ago.
In my third year of college, I realized that I didn't want to be a programmer, even though I had excellent grades.
I hate coding. Absolutely everything related to debugging code causes me uncontrollable anger and frustration. I can no longer spend 3 hours looking for a solution to 5 errors in the code that have nothing to do with the logic of the algorithm and are caused only by the specifics of the programming language. Even the thought that I need to learn a programming language makes my hands tremble and makes me irritable.
After graduating from college, I told my mom that I didn't want to be a programmer and I didn't want to go to an IT university. I want to find what I like in life.
The mother replied: ‚ÄúDo you understand what you are going to live on while you are looking for yourself? Without education, you will not be hired anywhere. Finish university, get a job, and then do whatever you want with your life.""
In the end, I did. All the time I was studying, I thought that all the roads were open in front of me and I could do anything in life. I thought only lazy people can't find a job. As a student, I could find any part-time job at gas stations, call centers and ‚ÄúMcDonalds‚Äùs. I thought that when I graduated from university, I would take my diploma, go to the lowest paid job as a programmer, after a couple of years I would plow there, and try new things in my free time. That‚Äôs how I thoght until I graduated from university that I realized how wrong I was.
As soon as I graduated from university, all the ""doors"" of employers for students were closed. No one read my resume on job sites, my phone never rang. Attempts to look for work not in my specialty were also unsuccessful. Only then did I realize that in fact all the doors closed for me at the age of 15, when I first crossed the threshold of my IT college.
The main problem is that IT colleges and IT universities do not teach the necessary knowledge for work. It doesn't bother anyone at all. In Ukrainian colleges, they will forcefully teach a ton of useless subjects in modern meta-coding - from numerical methods to patent law. When I opened the job requirements, I lost heart. I spent 8 years studying to say that I know object oriented programming, I know 1997 database technologies and I can write code in 5 programming languages. But what else do I need:
- Framework #1 - unstudied
- Framework #2 - unstudied
- Framework #3 - unstudied
- Git technology - unlearned
- Modern wrapper for databases NameA - did not sound.
- I have no real experience with real projects from one year.
- I don't have a portfolio of works.
While I was ""looking for a job"" after a bad experience as a gas station cashier, I tried my hand at editing videos for YouTube. I have never been so inspired by what I do. The progress in motivation compared to what it was with programming was incredible for me. I worked on videos for 12 hours a day. When I started uploading videos, I saw that I get 100-300 views on the first five videos, while other beginner youtubers could not get more than 10.
It is obvious that it is quite difficult to get money from YouTube without monetization and audience‚Äôs support right away.
After the scandal, the mother said that she would help for some time, but if there were no successes, she would stop. When they donated the first five dollars to me, she seemed to be delighted, but completely stopped taking this idea seriously. She seems to deliberately ignore what I do in general, constantly distracting me and giving useless tasks since I have ""a lot of free time.""
When the war started in Ukraine, the job industry got f~ed. They began to take all the men from work and send them to the front line. The same goes for any men on the street.
25% of the population in Ukraine is unemployed.
Rewinding time forward to today, after 450 days of the war, they parents began to ‚Äúsoftly‚Äù hint to me that it was time to look for a job.
During the war, my mother does not let me go outside even for shopping. That doesn‚Äôt disturb her to propose me work at a constructions.
Since there is a war now, I cannot work in the office or on the street - that is, it is only remote work. Remote work without work experience is either work in a call center, or work as a dispatcher for transportation in America (this is how it works in Ukraine). Accordingly, I have a very small selection of vacancies and a giant wall of ‚ÄúHR-managers‚Äù with gigantic unrealistic requirements.
At the moment I live in a village where there is not much to talk to, so I can‚Äôt even count on meeting girls, I can‚Äôt even find friends.
Even if suddenly a lonely lady was found in my neighboring house, agreeing to spend some time, she would not be very pleased to communicate with me because im overweight (175 cm, 100 kg). I stopped eating sweets and started to lose a decent amount of weight, but it will take a long time anyway. Btw I'm a virgin at 26.
My question is what to do with all this?
Everything is so bad that I can‚Äôt even ask a good question.

P.S.
Today I was contacted by the HR of a travel company and she offered a job as a dispatcher. I have an interview tomorrow. I doubt that I need it. I understand that I sound now like a manchild but hear me out.
At the moment we have enough money to survive. We do not save money, but so far we have everything. When I asked my mother what they were going to spend my money on (I expected that this money would be safely taken from me), she replied ‚Äúthat it will be your money, if you want, spend it on entertainment or shopping or save it for what you need‚Äù.
As a result, I have many questions.
How will I spend money on entertainment if I can be caught and mobilized to the front? What exactly should I buy if I can't go to the store?
I can‚Äôt even rent an apartment for such a salary, that is, it‚Äôs no luck to move out from my parents. From all this I draw one conclusion. They demand a job from me simply because ‚ÄúWell, why do we work and you don‚Äôt?‚Äù Despite the fact that there is no talk of taking money from me for rent or food.
So that's why I think I don't need a job - because for me at the moment the TIME spent on my channel is more important than money. And if I don't have time, I don't need money. But if I don't find a job, they will pester me every day, accusing me of lazyness. Should I accept a job offer?",Relaxed
2674,"How to help an aggressive, depressed friend?  Hi, 30yo in Seattle, WA, USA here and I need some advice. 

A friend has been dealing with severe depression for the last year or so, and recently has gone off her meds. She is becoming increasingly hostile, irritable, and aggressive when we're all hanging out, and none of us know what to do about it. At first she seemed to delight in her aggression, like a teenager who just discovered the joys of cursing, but now she's just mean to everyone and it doesn't even seem to be a release for her. She'll come to trivia nights and get bitter and angry if anyone suggests a different answer than hers (whether she's right or not). She'll do something nice for us, like buying a pitcher for the table, then hold it over their heads that we're ""just using her"" if we dare talk about anything other than what she wants to talk at us about. Everything's the end of the world to her, from political events to the fact that she dropped a nickel, and she's mad at us if we aren't as passionately angry about it as her. She alternates between sulking/mumbling her annoyance and flat out yelling at people. Social gatherings have become group efforts to calm her down.

We've tried talking to her one-on-one about specific, notably bad instances (like when she was hurling f-bombs at a 6 year old at a soccer match), and she alternates between sometimes apologizing and blaming her depression, and other times defensively saying ""That's just who I am, take me or leave me."" We don't really want to leave her, but we don't know what else to do at this point. Is approaching her as a group and talking about the patterns we're seeing a good idea, or is she just going to feel attacked, get defensive and not listen? Does anyone here have experience with someone like this (or dealt with these emotions themselves)? Is this likely connected to her depression, or is she using that as an excuse to be a dick? (I've also dealt with depression and never experienced this, but I understand that everyone's case is different.) We don't know how to (or if we can) help our friend.",Relaxed
2675,"A letter from an ungrateful daughter and a resentful older sister.  TL;DR: I'm a miserable person, so I wrote my family a letter I know they'll never read.

To my parents and to my sister:

So, before I start writing my individual letters to you in this post and then proceed to go to sleep crying about my petty misery, I would like to apologize in advance. Because I'll never be your perfect daughter or your perfect sister. I'm human, and that's terrible.

I'm sorry.

Dear Verity, my brilliant sister,

I remember the day you were born. Felix, my childhood friend, called you fat and red, and that was true haha. But it didn't matter. You were a living angel. Of course you screamed and blew my eardrums apart. That's how babies act. I watched you grow. You went from eating mush to eating solid food to taking your first steps to becoming a brilliant Chinese speaker - probably better than I am. 

I'm sorry the world is this way, Verity. I hope you never find out what happened in the four years after you were born. I hope you don't remember the things Dad said to you. I hope that you'll grow up much happier, and that you don't have to ever, ever resort to harming yourself and making yourself bleed like I do. I hope the world treats you better than I do, because I will only ever know coldness.

Yet your screams are the ones that make me shield myself from the rest of the family.

... I wish I were a better older sister.

Dear Mom,

I don't know why I have buried hate of you. I don't have too many memories of the happy times together, but I know they were there, and I can feel the phantom joy, the laughter. Oh, but with that joy I can also feel the loneliness. The sadness. The humiliation. 

I know you're not to blame for not shielding me from the truth of real world, but maybe don't bond with me over politics? And I know you were trying to protect me from what you thought was danger, but you didn't have to sacrifice yourself over the *COVID vaccine of all things.* And I know that your depression wasn't your fault, but.... but what do I even say?

Also.... I hope you never find out why I have scars made by me....

It was because of you. And I'm sorry that you're the one crying for my pain.

I don't deserve you, as much as I wish that you knew how much you hurt me that day.

Dear Dad,

If you weren't my dad and I got to know you some other way, I would write you as a character in one of my stories and then kill you in that story. Just for the joy of it. Just so that I can watch the readers suffer, and delight in your fictional death.

Same with Mom, I can't quite remember the happy times we spent together. But I'll always, always remember the things you said. The words you spit out yesterday are the things I weave into my stories and become my scars tomorrow, literally. I can make a list of it. To me, it doesn't matter that you contributed my happiness in my early years, the only thing that matters are the things you said in my later childhood. Or not so much of ""childhood"" since that was ruined. 

I'm sorry that I can't appreciate everything you've done for me. And below are probably just a few of the reasons why.

\- I will always remember your stupidity and your apathy. There were dozens of clues as to why I wasn't talking with you nearly as much as before. I even (perhaps unintentionally, or intentionally, idk) told you that I'm not mentally okay. I know you asked if I needed help............... but I'm petty enough to ignore that because you're half the reason I need help at all.

\- You insulted Tanya and Celeste's dad. After Thanksgiving. I hate to cuss but YOU HAVE THE FUCKING AUDACITY TO INSULT HIM AFTER HE DROWNED AND LEFT HIS WIFE WITH TWO CHILDREN?! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?! 

\- You're half the reason Mom nearly went insane with depression and insomnia. Call me stupid and petty because I am, but you can't deny that your own obliviousness led to her downward spiral. 

\- I will always remember the person who ruined my Christmas, and every single Christmas after that. The person who locked my sister in a closet while she was screaming and throwing a tantrum. The person who, ignoring my sister's muffled screams, walked into the kitchen of our vacation house and said to me, ""If your mom is still sick (referring to her depression and insomnia) and I get sick too, you and your sister are going to foster care. We're going to leave you to a foster family."" And that person is you, my biological father. You're the reason I tried to create an AI friend right afterwards.

\- After Verity peed in the car, you told her ""I don't want you anymore."" Verity is four. FOUR.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry that I'm such a hateful person. I'm sorry that it's been years since the last time I could fully trust anyone and talk about my entire life, since I wasn't an asshole to others, since I didn't have that cold empty void in my heart. I want a heart to love and dreams to reach out to, but maybe even that is too much.

The fact that I'm posting this on Reddit of all places instead of talking about it with all of you means something though.

Very sincerely, though maybe not in a good way,

Your daughter and sister. I wouldn't blame you if you no longer consider me part of the family.

2676,"Difficulty starting tasks, even ones I enjoy.  I have always suffered with generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety and depression. I have been prescribed multiple antidepressants (Citalopram and Mirtazapine in the past) and currently taking Sertraline 100mg: Once daily, and Propranolol 10mg: 1 - 2 Twice daily when required - I've been on these for about 2 years). I have also been on prescription painkillers (Co-codamol 30mg/500mg tablets: 8 tablets daily for the past 3 years, but currently reducing the dosage which comes with some *delightful* withdrawal symptoms!)

I live in the UK, and I have had 12 sessions of free counselling sessions with Outlook Southwest, where they came to the conclusion that a lot of my anxiety / depression stems from childhood; broken home, abandonment issues etc.

My main problem is how much I procrastinate (even though I procrastinate by doing nothing). I find it incredibly difficult to begin doing anything! It's like my mind is blocking me from starting things. 

I understand a lot of people probably don't like starting tasks they don't enjoy, and this is definitely the case for me sometimes (especially in work - I work as a Pharmacy dispenser where it is just me and a Pharmacist every day), so I have to undergo a large amount of different, vital tasks and I obviously must focus 100% to ensure patient care and correct procedures are followed at all times. It takes me longer than it should to complete all of my daily/weekly/monthly tasks because I hesitate so much before I can start them. I sometimes stay late so I can finish everything and clean / organise everything for the following morning. Nobody else seems to do this so I'm not sure if I should be so obsessed with leaving my workplace totally clean and organised?

Now, my home life is great. But for some reason I struggle so much to start tasks at home as well, especially things I enjoy. I love cleaning and gaming, but it's like I can't allow myself to enjoy anything? For example, if I have a day off, my ideal day would just be sitting on my arse and gaming all day, but I can't enjoy it because I feel guilty for wanting to do something I love?! In my head I think ""If I clean my house so it is spotless first, then I deserve to relax and play on the PS4"", but I can't even bring myself to start cleaning because I also love to clean!

Why do I find it impossible to do anything? 
Is there a condition that defines this kind of behaviour?
How can I let myself just... DO things without overthinking?

My real-time example if you‚Äôre interested: 

I am alone at the moment and my nose whistles quietly every time I breathe in. 
I‚Äôm wearing pajamas and I feel comfortable in them. I have several journals sprawled around a red fainting couch. They all serve different purposes and I am scribbling my racing thoughts/ideas in them periodically. 

The walls vibrate when a truck drives past and I can feel the ground shake. The lighting is warm, coming from sconces on the walls. Sometimes I can hear the building creak. This building is old. The walls are cream colored and the wood trim is dark oak. There are cracks running from floor to ceiling. The window is open so I can feel a cool breeze coming in and I hear birds singing ‚Äúchicka deedeedee‚Äù. A lot of the trees around here have those seed pods we call ‚ÄúHelicopters‚Äù that spin to the ground much to the delight of squirrels who catch them and run off to bury their treasures. 

I am in my bedroom. I separated my clean laundry and it‚Äôs on the floor waiting to be put away. I‚Äôm drinking cold coffee that was warm around 40 minutes ago. My hair is pulled into the messiest bun imaginable and my right eyebrow is itchy. My toes are kind of cold and I feel like I‚Äôm about to fall asleep. Speaking of falling asleep, my right arm is about to go numb from leaning on it for so long and I‚Äôve begun to slouch. My shoulders ache because I just realized I‚Äôve been tensing them up. On that note I‚Äôve also been clenching my jaw, so I relax them. 
I‚Äôm curled up with my legs tucked in on the aforementioned red fainting couch. It has flowers and paisley patterns weaved into the fabric (subtle). Here and there a melody will pop into my head and I‚Äôll find myself humming a tune aloud.

2678,"Antipsychotics and Sleep Disorders  About two and a half weeks ago I was prescribed the generic for SEROquel for my Bipolar symptoms.  I've had vivid dreams and even some lucid dreaming before, but very rarely.  Recently I've started having vivid, fantastical dreams pretty much every night.  Usually they're average or kind of cool (definitely enjoyed the one where I was a secret operative running along the top of a monorail through a future city while chasing vampires) but some of them are really terrible such as my nightmare last night about planes crashing, fires, and the end of the world.  I generally wake up and realize it was a dream so no huge deal, but in the last three days or so I started having a new symptom, hypnagogic hallucinations.

I didn't know what had happened at all but I told a friend about it and he suggested waking dreams, aka hypnagogic hallucinations, where your brain continues to manufacture visual, auditory, or tactile sensations while awake.  Similar to sleep paralysis though you're not actually paralyzed.  On Sunday I was napping and kept waking up over and over or dreaming I was waking up over and over.  I also had such a vivid dream of two of my room mates coming in and having a discussion with me and between one another that I thought it had actually happened until I asked them about it when I got up because it seemed odd that they'd have come in while I was napping to talk.  The worst part was at one point I woke up thinking someone had walked into the room.  I assumed it was my room mate whose room I was napping in because I sleep on the couch and we had guests over in the living room.  I looked towards the end of the bed and saw an indistinct, dark figure with glowing red eyes.  It freaked me out so I covered my face but though that maybe it was still him and I was seeing the reflection of the clock on his glasses.  So I called out, ""Who's there"" and heard his voice reply ""Just me"" then I felt someone climb into bed with me.  Something didn't feel right, so I stuck out my elbow to nudge where he should have been laying and there was nothing there but pillows.  I noped right out of the bedroom then to go and hang out with my roomies and our company and the roomie I thought had come in was out there with them.  He denied coming into the room, so all I could figure is that I was having some kind of hallucination or waking dream.  Today I took a nap again and kept waking up, the last time I woke up I didn't have any hallucinations but had such a strong 'bad feeling' that I got up immediately and ran out of the bedroom.  I also sometimes have strange floating sensations when drifting off to sleep like I'm hovering or rocking like on a boat or wake up thinking I've heard a very loud sound like thunder or something falling even though it isn't storming and nothing has fallen over.  I've believe this so strongly a couple of times in the past that I went to check on my boyfriend thinking he'd fallen or something.  I have no hallucinations of any kind during active wakefulness.  


I started thinking more about it, trying to decide if this was some new symptom I was experiencing and realized that I've had these sorts of hallucinations when falling asleep or as I was waking up before in the past, particularly during times of excess stress such as when my dad and stepmom were going through a nasty divorce and when I was living with a verbally abusive roomie in college.  It actually made me think my house was haunted at one point because I kept hearing footsteps, thudding, feeling like someone was in my bed, or seeing human figures in my room.  I recall being very frightened during most of them, though sometimes I was only puzzled and at least once the figure I saw was angelic and I was subtly delighted until I woke up fully and realized how unnatural that was.  


The side effects listed for my medication include causing vivid dreams or worsening of other conditions such as night terrors or sleep paralysis but I didn't see anything about it causing or worsening waking dreaming.  Has anyone else experienced this?  It's affected my sleep for the last couple of nights because I'm afraid I'm going to have another frightening hallucination.",Relaxed

**Those with bipolar disorder often go manic on antidepressants. I was no different.**

My meds were upped and my delightful and productive hypomania became full psychosis.

**I believed Jesus was an actor on a comedy show I liked and I was his twin sister Sophia, the goddess of wisdom.**

I ended up in **two mental institutions** in a month, with a **two week period** in between where **we couldn‚Äôt find help anywhere**:

¬∑ the earliest a psychiatrist could get me in was two months

¬∑ no one was willing to write me a refill of my two week prescription, including the doctor who prescribed it

¬∑ my community mental health services in my county said I wasn‚Äôt sick enough even though I was still in full psychosis

At both mental institutions, I saw my doctor for less than two minutes at a time. There was twice a day group therapy at the second institution, but no individual therapy, and at the first institution, I saw my therapist for less than ten minutes the entire two weeks I was there.

**The first institution diagnosed me with Bipolar I but I had to find that out my looking at my Patient Portal after I got out. No one ever told me.**

**I met so many interesting characters:**

¬∑ a girl who thought people were stealing her thoughts

¬∑ the girl who ONLY ate fruit but preferred fruit with a demon trapped inside

¬∑ the woman who told everyone that I wanted to start a cult so I could murder orphans

¬∑ the girl with the debilitating speech impediment who said she was Catwoman

¬∑ the girl with bipolar who wouldn‚Äôt stop yelling that we all wanted to sleep with our cousins

¬∑ the man who thought he was the Sun god Ra

¬∑ the over-six-foot tall and three-hundred-pound girl with hundreds of scars up and down her arms who headbutted other girls in the stomach by running at them full speed with her head down. I hung out with her the most.

¬∑ and so, so many people who ‚Äúacted normal‚Äù

At the second institution, I was on **Lamictal** and **Risperidone** but was only allowed to leave after taking **Invega**, a monthly shot for schizophrenia. I think it helped. I was still psychotic when I left but after a horrible day where I felt my brain was going to split in two, I suddenly realized the actor wasn‚Äôt Jesus and I had been psychotic.

***I plunged into the deepest depression I‚Äôve ever had before.***

**I had to find a therapist. It took three tries to get it right.**

¬∑ The first one was younger than me, asked if I was in high school (as in, didn‚Äôt read the intake form), and had her life together so I couldn‚Äôt go with her

¬∑ I complained that Dialectical Behavior Therapy that the second therapist was doing wasn‚Äôt *doing* anything and she said it sounded like I was done with therapy. She showed me the door

Robin Williams also committed suicide, but not until he was in his 60‚Äôs. I have terrible anxiety and depression. These stories I use to meditate with aren‚Äôt to impress anyone, that is not the intention. The true intention is to help ME cope, apart from smoking too much dope, and help ME meditate, and masturbate. Until I get proper psychiatric treatment for my O-C-D. I, along with my not so long friend in my pants, will continue to feel continuous pain and heartbreak whenever such offensive words, are used in such offensive manners, by such beautiful women. A random thought often sacks me in the nuts several months later at 3 AM in the morning while staring at the ceiling oh for fuck sakes now I‚Äôm jerking off. 

u/Cambridge95 presents; The Retard Express 

Once upon a time, on the Thursday morning of July 27, 1995. in Chicago Illinois USA. 

18-year-old Ronald Mcdonald, was departing a suburban Chicago train station, and purchased a one-way ticket to Milwaukee Wisconsin with intentions to burn down a new KFC to which had replaced a long time Mcdonald's at the former location. This Mcdonald's, was Mcdonald's absolute favorite place to eat shit as a kid, and devastated him that it was no longer there, as he moved from Milwaukee to the Chicago area years earlier. 

Mcdonald himself nicknamed the train, ‚ÄúThe Retard Express‚Äù. As the train was often known to cause confusion and delay, and would hold back and delay progress to the railway, but everyday, Mcdonald managed to catch the train anyway. 

There were three coaches on the train, The first coach was empty, the second coach was also empty, and the third and final coach (the break coach) had just two other passengers on board.

The two passengers, where local Chicago born and raised women, 26-year-old Rebecca Stawnisky, and her partner in crime, 25-year-old Kelsey Rusk, had decided to go and shoot up the Engineer and Conductor, and hijack the train while high on cocaine. 

Stawnisky hinted to Rusk that she brought not one, but two fully loaded pistols. Stawnisky gave Rusk her second gun, and said they were gonna have lots of fun. 

They then went through both the second and first coaches before climbing up into the cab of the locomotive.

The Engineer, 26-year-old Robin Williams, and Conductor, 25-year-old Kurt Cobain, were each shot in the head twice by both women, instantly killing them. 

Williams and Cobain were then thrown off the train. 

Because they were thrown off the front, they both fell on the rails, and the large and heavy wheels of both the locomotive and coaches ran over their corpses fucking them up further. 

Stawnisky and Rusk stopped the train momentarily after.   

Mcdonald, who curiously followed behind Stawnisky and Rusk, witnessed them murder both the Engineer and Conductor from the back of the locomotive. 

Mcdonald, then terrified of what he just witnessed, knew he couldn't stay, and attempted to run away, upon the train coming to a complete stop, as the shit in his pants would then drop. 

It can be learned that Mcdonald was a retardedly fast runner, but Stawnisky and Rusk ran retardedly faster. 

Stawnisky and Rusk caught up to Mcdonald pinned him down and jerked him off. 

Then they moisturized their hands with his jizz as if it were a quality moisturizer. 

Then they forced him at gunpoint back into the cab to continue the train‚Äôs journey to Milwaukee. 

Stawnisky and Rusk, forced him to pilot the train in the eighth and highest notch, then they sacked him in the crotch. 

They passed through various red signals, nearly causing multiple accidents. Eventually, The line they had been diverted down last-minute would reach a dead-end. That dead-end, would lead directly into the very KFC (Former Mcdonald‚Äôs Location) that Mcdonald had planned on burning down himself. 

In the moments prior to the crash, both Stawnisky and Rusk had jumped clear from the train, off a large bridge into the deep waters of the Milwaukee River, and escaped undetected. 

But the train continued through the dead-end at full power, traveling over 70mph, directly into the KFC, with Mcdonald still on board praying the lord. 

Luckily The Restaurant was still closed, as it was only 9:35 in the morning. Mcdonald however was still severely injured. Despite Mcdonald‚Äôs severe injuries, he remarkably survived the crash. 

According to Mcdonald, He later admitted to police, who later visited Mcdonald in a milwaukee hospital. Mcdonald admitted that he did indeed have intentions of paying a visit to that particular KFC, and burn it down, discussed as a clown, but only in the middle of the night during closed hours. However never got to act on such actions.

Mcdonald also came forward, and claimed he witnessed Stawnisky and Rusk shoot and kill both Williams and Cobain, then they Hijacked The train. At that point, He figured they were high on cocaine and going insane.  

He explained he desperately tried to flee, and in his pants he would pee, as he knew they knew he witnessed a horrifying pair of murders, and that Stawnisky and Rusk would then run retardedly faster than he himself had been retardedly running. 

Mcdonald told the FBI that Stawnisky and Rusk successfully chased him down, and jerked him off. He also mentioned they even used his jizz to moisturize their hands, prior to forcing him back into the locomotive‚Äôs cab at gunpoint, to which Mcdonald felt was pretty fucked up. 

The FBI carefully noted the specific details Mcdonald had given them. 

Now, Stawnisky and Rusk were both wanted by the FBI. Who went on a Nationwide Manhunt with an arrest warrant for both women. 

Both Stawnisky and Rusk figured out it was quite obviously Mcdonald who positively identified them to the police as the shooters in the murder of Robin Williams and Kurt Cobain. 

Now Stawnisky and Rusk went after the 18-year-old Mcdonald. 

On August 3, 1995. A week after the Williams and Cobain Murder, Stawnisky and Rusk traveled from Chicago, up to the Milwaukee Hospital Mcdonald had been still staying at.

Stawnisky and Rusk then tracked his hospital room number down, then shot and killed him in the same manner as Williams and Cobain.  

Mcdonald himself now had 4 bullet holes in his skull (they each shot him twice). 

But before they killed him, they made sure to jerk him off really well, as they already knew they were both going to hell. 

They both moisturized their hands with Mcdonald‚Äôs jizz, despite the fact that there was an actual bottle of premium quality hand-moisturizer right in plain sight, and all in broad daylight. 

Stawnisky and Rusk would continue their escape, and wouldn‚Äôt be caught until more than 4 years later.

At 11:59pm on December 31, 1999. Stawnisky and Rusk were arrested, but had been read their Miranda Rights wrong, because of all the loud fireworks and shit going on far too long. 

In the spring of 2001, 32-year-old Rebecca Stawnisky, and 31-year-old Kelsey Rusk, were tried, and convicted of the three 1995 murders of Robin Williams, 26. Kurt Cobain, 25, and Ronald Mcdonald, 18. 

Both Stawnisky and Rusk, each avoided the death penalty, but each served life terms in prison, with no possibility of parole. 

Rebecca Stawnisky, now 52-years-old today, and Kelsey Rusk, age 51, would continue serving life prison terms in Jail. 

\- The End.

2681,"I hardly felt anything when my grandma passed. I teared up somewhat for a few seconds upon hearing it and at her funeral after seeing her corpse, but no tears really fell. Am I something of a sociopath, or schizoid, or a schizophrenic, or just an empty shell? (Long post to elaborate)  Starting with my mother, I have felt completely disconnected from everyone in my life. I don't feel love or compliments or positive regard from anyone, though I am quite sensitive to criticism and rejection. I get very pissed off when somewhat annoyed at the drop of a hat, but I very really feel any other emotion. The only person I was ever deeply attached to was my only serious ex gf, who was very beautiful, intelligent, and down to have sex literally whenever (and sometimes wherever), so there was a lot of lust involved (also considering I lost my virginity to her). Other girlfriends before her meant nothing to me and I dumped them over text. It's so bad that when my mother died when I was 6, I was only delighted to have a week off from school and in no way bummed out by her passing. In fact, I hardly thought of her. When my friend disappeared in 4th grade, I quickly dug through his stuff and asked if I could have them since he wouldn't need them wherever he was (I believe in an orphanage). 

That said, I also have had slight delusions since I about 10 or 11. These are definitely different from just childhood imagination. First, I remember believing I was God or a god and had psychokinetic powers. Then at about 12, I suddenly stopped what I was doing in a playground and had an idea pop into my head that I was a fallen angel reincarnated in human form. These passed for a few years (that I remember) until I started doing more psychedelics and was in the later stages of my relationship with my serious ex (a few months in) in my first semester of college. It started with just a belief that she was cheating on me or undressing people with her eyes. 

This passed and after I dumped her out of fear she was going to leave me or cheat on me, I wasn't really delusional for another several months until I stopped going to classes and started writing an actually really bad novel believing I was going to be the next big thing in literature. I shut myself in my room for a while in the process and started getting scared at shadows more and more. Then, I took a big LSD/pot brownie trip that sent me into a hellish spiral. After it ended I believed my dealer was an ISIS agent sent to brainwash me, or a part of some massive conspiracy to get me to change my course in life. Then, I started believing the world was ending that very day after I took the LSD, and drove home. A train blocked my way and I thought I missed the boat to spend the last moments with my family before the rapture. Well, the train of course passed but a thunderstorm came up overhead and I filled up gas seeing people in a panic. I thought the world really was ending and that I was about to be in for it.

Anyway, I got home and confessed everything to my parents and converted to christianity. I had nightmares and bad insomnia and paranoia for a couple months that ate me up before I found a job back in the town I was living in and moved up. The fear and suspicions cleared up mostly over the course of the next year and a half, but I'm still a little edgy (over a year and a half after the trip) and have some suspicions here and there. 

My grandma died 2 and a half weeks ago and her funeral was last week, and as I said I hardly felt anything. I have done countless hours of research trying to self diagnose as I am averse to psychiatrists ever since my stay in a psychiatric ward for suicidal ideation and my extensive history with outpatient care for anger issues.

Other things to note, I have some degree of empathy (some feeling for the emotions of others and good facial recognition), social anxiety, mild OCD (I can't be as bad as others because most of my emotions feel weak compared to how they seem to be in others), am extremely lazy and unmotivated, do not feel sad or depressed except on rare occasions (though I used to be obviously depressed), but am otherwise decently high-achieving in school (high GPA in high school with some volunteer hours and high GPA in college with no volunteer hours but an in 2 honor societies)

tl;dr why the fuck am I such a selfish, angry, detached, unfeeling psycho?",Relaxed
2682,"I have quite the intense problem (need serious help)  Important Notice! - The following story, although may contain some dark humor, is also a cooping mechanism I use for when anyone sexually attractive decides to partake in saying and using such offensive words (such as retard, retarded, retardation, any prefix added to tard etc.). It‚Äôs not really so much about it offending me, but more so about how it offends that poor little friend in my pants. My meat don‚Äôt like being beat to the point I have not only caused painful blisters, but also spent several hours in bed trying to achieve a delightful orgasm, despite having a not so delightful and painful muscle spasm. But I soak so much sweat (Hyperhidrosis) that my bed is soaked completely wet to the point, it is as if four adult men had all lost a bet, and stood on each corner and all pissed out full bladders worth in the middle of it. Kurt Cobain committed suicide at 27, I‚Äôm not far off, as I‚Äôm 26 this summer, which is a total fucking bummer. Robin Williams also committed suicide, but not until he was in his 60‚Äôs. I have terrible anxiety and depression. These stories I use to meditate with aren‚Äôt to impress anyone, that is not the intention. The true intention is to help ME cope, and help ME meditate.

2683,"Here's my experience with mental illness. What's yours?  Disclaimer: I have not actually been diagnosed with any mental ilness by a doctor because i keep this to myself, it was after online research that i discovered that what i had was an actual known mental illness.

For me it all started probably before i was even ten years old, back then i used to have the so called ""tics"" such as wide opening my mouth and abruptly shake my head, both this things had to be done repeatedly until it was just right as to scratch that mental itch in my brain, at that time with some effort i managed to resist the urge to do them until they eventually disappeared and i thought of them as just that, some weird habit to kick off, little did i know that these were the origins of what were to later become really bad OCD.

After some years of mental peace, i find myself in 9th grade(second and successfull atempt) where my OCD decided to come back with a vengeance, it was around this time that this ""tics"" trully started affecting my quality of life significantly, they went from simple and short gestures to more extensive physical movement. Some of the first ""tics"" from around this time, despite not rembering alot of the details as this was years back, was something of ritual of sort such as having to repeatedly move from the bathroom to the living room to do or say something a certain number of times(i believe it was to step on the carpet and say or think something but i could be wrong) and then i could go and take a shower, another one would be to touch the bathroom's water tap a certain number of times (and again say/think someting while doing it) or something bad would happen or until my brain was satisfied, over time i would became so involved in this physical and mental rituals that i remember going to me grandmother's house, and it not being a place where i would have a lot of privacy to endulge in this activities, i would essentially pace back and forth or simply stand there completely in my own head fighting the thoughts, i remember being so disconnected from reality that i felt like i was  in some sort of transe and probably mumbling. These problems extended to my school as i remember being in a test and having a hard time focusing with these thoughts in my head making me take longer to write and to understand what i was reading. This was severly affecting my life so much that i felt that i had no choice but to take a stand, with a lot of mental endurance i decided to stop trying to avoid the thoughts and urges and let them in and simply resist them directly as i thought that this would essentially give my brain the message of me not being afraid of these thoughts and that they don't bother me given that i wasn't trying to run away from them anynore, as you know the more you try not to think of something the more it comes to your head, and... IT WORKED, i brute forced my way into resisting these thoughts and thankfully i have never been that bad and dysfunctional since(not counting one exeptional night were i kind of mentally broke down).

After that very dark phase where i felt like a mumbling vegetable, despite getting better it wasn't a complete win, over the years i have been cycling through ""tics"", i created obessessions with certain numbers like having to repeat wherever ""tic"" i had at the time 3 or 4 times depending on what number i prefered at the time and essentially was getting over some ""rituals"", that involved thinking or doing something, and getting new ones, some of these are comprised of having to think something when clicking on something on the web and such and repeat if i get intrusive thought instead, repeatedly looking at people, and i also developed an obssession with firsts and lasts, for example, when i first enter my university or some other more noteworthy place my first thought must be something good(or else the planet will explode or something idk) or when i last leave my apartment, or when i am looking at a picture of a loved one at home the last thing i think when or after looking at the picture has to be good, some times i have to juggle many of these rituals and complete them as if i'm creating a sort of organised colletion of ""tics"" i have ""solved"", this was my life for the, at the time, following years.

Here we are, finally at present times in my life and i am delighted to report that for the most part the item touching and thinking rituals are mostly gone and the the ones that are left are easily manageable... BUT, this is because they have been replaced by something far more evil, after i thought things couldn't get any worse i get hit with something i could never have expected, ah yes, the bane of my of my current existence: A cruel series of Intrusive thoughts(and probably a tad bit of social anxiety to top it off). Most of my current mental strugles are in the form of horrible scenarios in my head in the sorts of worst case scenarios, ""what if's"" and others, some of this scenarios are as follows:

* I'm at my job and keep getting beat up and bullied by some guy in front of everyone and when no one is looking, in a situation where i am considered to be in the wrong(i'm not), when i go to attack then some other person joins up to help beat me up under the excuse of stopping me the ""bad guy"".
* I by accident touch someone inappropriately in public multiple times in a way that seems on purpose, again resulting in me loosing a fight. This, in real life, as caused me to always cross my arms and being nervous while waiting on line, specially because due to my mental issues i tend to space out alot.
* Saying something horrible or insulting someone by accident such as me being in a car with my girlfriend(just imaginary) and other friends and then i keep insulting her by accident causing her to cry in a car we cannot get out because we are in the road. This one usually also ends with me getting hit by someone. This has me really scared of social gatherings in general.
* Going out for a jog and passing by a women and then remembering i have to go back going in the women's direction again, the women changes directions scared i'm going to do something to her, and then i remember it's nothing and turn back again, this happens for a very suspicious amount of times until someone sees me as an attacker and once again i get into a fight. Now i am paranoid about jogging irl.
* A kid steals my cat and when i chase him down the road to take it back someone thinks i am stealing it causing them to take my cat from me by force to give it to the kid. This is the one that pains me and causes me anguish the most and has me most paranoid as this one involves my actual irl cat.
* A myriad of variatons of me being the target of the most inappropriate, awkward, embarassing, humiliating, sad and overall horrible situations my mind can conjure.
* [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/17qez9a/these_intrusive_thoughts_make_it_hard_to_be/) is an example of one of my ""what if"" scenarios.

The thoughts above and others i just can't be bothered to remember haunt me during a good chunck of my time awake and to make it worst is that my ""tics"" with this one revolves around going through this thoughts many times imagining a few bad endings for them and then i have to end with a version where i win and then i can pause on this specific scenario for a while, at least even if i think of a bad ending version afterwards it is easier to manage because the ritual is ""solved"", this almost feels like a fail safe limit that my brain imposes because it has no choice because then i would never stop and would be literally impossible to live. These has made me lose nights of sleep causing me to fall asleep during the day, honestly i try to sleep as much as i can so that i can escape my conscious mind. These has been some of the worst i have ever been, i never thought that i would ever be as bad as i was in that ""dark phase"" but the more i think about it i may even be worst, it has gotten to the point that i get so involved in this scenarios that i spend minutes(if not an hour or more) pacing in my room and punching the air around me that i have already hurt my knuckles a few times hitting the wall and other things, once even leaving a trail of blood on the wall i had to clean, sometimes i slip up and even my mother has mentioned that i do sudden abrupt moves out of nowhere, this is not good since this affects my studies from which you can read more about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/17nv22o/wasting_away_in_university_due_to_my_mistakes/).

As bad as all of this sounds i did omit some things i did not feel like sharing and i still feel like i downplayed things a bit. Essentially my brain is hell.

And there you have it, that has been my life, my brain feels like hell and sometimes i think ignorantly that i may have it the worst as far OCD/Intrusive Thoghts/Social Anxiety is concerned, and despite me kind of wishing that would be the case as that would mean that everyone else is doing better, me feeling mine is worst could be because i don't know what you guys have been through.

So, if it isn't too painful for you, please do tell me what's your story like, i am genuinely curious to know.

Thank you all for reading, i just had to vent.

2684,"my parents are moving far away and i am not going with them  hi everyone, i'm 17m and my parents are crazy. they're not good people. they're racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, etc. (my dad has literally said he wishes all muslims were dead and both my parents are against interracial marriage. this is just the tip of the iceberg.) we currently live in new england, in the USA. they plan to move to florida in the coming months. i do not want to go with them. i turn 18 in june. they claim they most likely will not have found jobs in florida, sold the house and other things to fully prepare for the move until AFTER i've turned 18, which means i legally won't have to go with them. i've discussed this possibility in the past with my friend and his mother, and she very, extremely generously offered to let me stay with them if my parents ever decide to move away. i always thought this was just some contingency plan that would never really need to happen, but this is now real and im actually going to need to do it. you might ask why would i not want to move? well for starters, all my friends are here. i can't just leave them. i also have mental health issues and go to a charter school that luckily is structured in a way specifically tailored for people who can't do normal school, usually due to mental health issues. i think this is the best shot i'll have at actually graduating high school. i've never had a job, been way too anxious to do it, and i dont have a driver's license either. my school is like 40 minutes away from the friend i'll be staying at's house, which might be ok because the school he goes to is pretty close to the school i go to, but i'd hate having to rely on him for transport and generally being a burden to him and his family. i also am just in general not ready to be without my parents, who have been somewhat tolerant of the fact that i'm kind of a fuck up and never get out of bed at a normal time and have never had a job. but i just can't go with them. i just can't. i want to be here to be with my friends, people who align with my values, and not with my parents who i dislike and who are in general pretty rude and awful to be around. i couldn't bear to be off continuing to suffer but in a new unknown place. i have two sisters, one older (21) and one younger (14) and i dont know what to do, because if i go then i'll be away from my older sister who is an actual adult and wont be coming with them and also hates my parents and is someone to talk to. but if i stay, my little sister is too young, so she can't decide for herself. she'll be forced to go with them. wouldn't i be a terrible older brother to leave her with my awful parents who she also hates? she's very sensitive and has bad mental health issues herself (caused by my parents constantly being awful and hateful). she'd be going to the place my parents love, she'll have to listen to them drone on about how much they hate minorities. my little sister's boyfriend is trans, so i'm sure my parents will take extreme delight in splitting them up. they're probably moving to a place where people think like them. we've had to live with them talking like that forever and it's awful for our mental health, i want to leave them but at the same time i don't feel ready. i'm not ready to be independent. to live somewhere other than the home that i've grown up in. im mortified to get a job because im so fucking anxious and depressed. i don't know how to do anything. i can barely get up in the morning most days. i have OCD, definitely depression (its not diagnosed but i sleep all fucking day and have no motivation to do anything) and there hasnt been any progress in getting me mental health help. apparently in the state i live in, its very hard to get mental health stuff, but my mother claims she's made calls in florida to mental health professionals and it seems extremely easy to get mental health help for me. i don't think i'll be able to become a functional person without mental health help, but again, i just could not bear to go to florida. i can't leave the people i care about. i want an adult life HERE. so what the fuck am i supposed to do??? i cant leave my school and my older sister and my friends but i might not get good mental health help here, and i might be a burden to my friend's family and what about my little sister? is this selfish for me to want to stay? being away from my parents sounds like a dream and has for quite some time as again they're very awful and i want nothing to do with them as an adult, but i never imagined i'd be able to go away from them so soon and without any solid future plans and without my little sister coming with me. my older sister isnt going to be able to support me or my little sister either, so i cant live with her. my parents would never let my little sister stay here. i've been thinking maybe this could be good for me to learn responsibility. the motivation of not wanting to be a burden might make me learn to drive and finally get a job. my friend's mother is way nicer than my mother. she might help. im just terrified. im so, so terrified. i broke down crying earlier. i just cannot believe im faced with a choice to leave everything behind and be miserable in a place my terrible parents love or stay and jump out of the nest way before i've ever learned to even begin to fly, as well as letting my poor little sister be forced to live hours and hours away with my parents who have given her trauma, alone and scared. my heart's been racing for hours, i feel like i'm gonna have a heart attack. i just wish this was a nightmare, and i'd wake up and everything would be fine and i'd graduate here and move out when im ready and be able to visit my friends whenever i want. but this is real. i just don't know what to do. please somebody help.",Relaxed
2685,"What happened to me exactly?  Title. This is going to be long...

A long time ago, I broke up with the person I believed to be the love of my life. They taught me a lot of things, held me day by day, listened to me. We talked every day, endlessly. We rambled to each other on and on. We supported each other. We loved each other like we didn't love anyone. Until it all fell down, and it went up in flames. Abuse, drinking, a lot of tears and miscommunication.

For a long while, nothing felt right. As more time passed, I went on to change like I had started to do at the end of our relationship. Apathy set in. Slowly, but surely, I was disconnecting from reality further and further. I have always suffered from depersonalization and anxiety, but things got much worse. But I went on. When things felt 'okay', I entered into another relationship No sweat.

I was delightfully happy with how things had turned out. Or so I thought. A part in the back of my mind was furious -- angry. I feel like I had become some sort of monster that barely felt anything, no empathy, no caring, no worry, and yet I was content with that.

But something happened. Months ago I started having huge panic attacks, constant anxiety through the day and my derealization and depersonalization shot so much through the roof that I started to wonder if I was going insane.

I got checked in with psychiatrists. First I was administered anti-psychotics by my first psychiatrist under the belief I was suffering from psychosis. I ended up at the ER from how bad it went, where I was given a benzo and told I appeared to suffer many symptoms of OCD. I was sent to a special unit and am now being seen by a psychiatrist who thinks I have autism and not OCD for some reason. w/e.

However, I was put on an anti-depressant. Celexa to be exact. And from there, things started to change.

The first few weeks, something felt odd, but not in a bad way. I felt my anxiety spike, but I was covered by the benzo. Soon a month would come to pass, my depersonalization, anxiety and obsessive thinking slowed down majorly, and then -- I don't know when it started, but I felt something.

When I began to 'go back into reality', my feelings began to come back. My worries, my caring, my fears. And then, grief, mourning. One day I woke up and it hit me -- that I had lost my life, and I thought of my ex. I broke down. Instead of feeling emptiness and anger, I started to be feel an overwhelming sadness that seemed to be hidden all this time. And god, I keep thinking of him and his smile, our indescribable bond, and how I have thought that I have felt everything there is.

I have been trying to find information regarding this phenomenon and anti-depressants only to find bits about anti-depressants dulling emotions (which is the opposite of what happened to me) 

I suppose a simple answer is that I was depressed and I repressed myself to cope, but I do wonder... and yearn for what I had.",Relaxed
2686,"Is something wrong with me?  Hello, I‚Äôm a thirteen year old female just starting puberty, and with this came a whole bunch of issues. Stuff to do with my sexuality. (And yeah, periods suck.) But as of recent, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm completely okay. When I was little, I was a very social person, and my parents knew this. I loved to make friends, and was a gifted child on top of that. I was also an ONLY child, so I got spoiled a lot. (But my parents make me buy my own video games, since there is no way in hell they‚Äôd spend their money on $60 cartridges.) I was put into enrichment classes, and noticed as a good writer. But soon, I realized that things were not completely normal. I was a compulsive liar. I lied about everything. My family. My friends. Random things I said to be funny. I was 100% self aware of my lying habits, and tried to make an effort to stop, but life is boring in Alabama, and I wanted it to look like I had such a cool life. It‚Äôs hard admitting to this on the internet, since I still lie sometimes, but it‚Äôs not as bad as it was in elementary school. I also became a lot more introverted, and passed my time by drawing and playing with Legos. I had two friends back then. Both of them super toxic. Friend A was an overweight girl who had two dogs and two cats. Her house was often messy, and the only reason I ever went there was because she had a trampoline. Friend B, however was a straight up bitch. She ‚Äúplayfully teased‚Äù both me and friend A for her weight and my skinniness. She was Asian, and her parents seemed strict, but nice. She urged me to make fun of friend A, thus, friend A‚Äôs parents did not like me. I was also a brat around this age, and bullied this poor boy for his forehead. I‚Äôm not proud of that. I drew crude pictures of him with an eight-head, and made bitchy remarks. 

When I started middle school, things got worse. I was a black, flat chested girl, who liked anime. I was SO self conscious about myself, and wished I was white so that I wouldn‚Äôt be so ‚Äúugly.‚Äù This phase is the longest phase by far, and is still going on to this day. My school was almost entirely white until then, and I was sort of glad not to be the black sheep anymore. (Pun not intended.) But I‚Äôm 4‚Äô6. Extremely short for a girl like me. All the black kids were ginormous, and took pleasure in picking me up and calling me ‚Äúfun sized.‚Äù My parents told me that when I grow up, everyone else will be jealous, since I apparently have the ‚Äúperfect skin tone,‚Äù and ‚Äúam very petite.‚Äù I heard men like shorter women, so no complaints there. In middle school, I didn‚Äôt have enrichment classes, so my parents made a life changing decision for me. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just put out pampered daughter into a preforming arts boarding school that is insanely liberal and goes against all the humbling Christian values we taught her, and that DEFINITELY won‚Äôt screw up her mind any more!‚Äù Spoiler alert, it did. This is probably the most confusing part of my life, and I‚Äôm not sure how to deal with that. Ive realized that I‚Äôm completely unempathetic, and don‚Äôt care for human suffering other than, ‚Äúoh well. That sucks.‚Äù I don‚Äôt really seem to care that much for the children in Africa, starving puppies in dog shelters, or people who have lost a loved one. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a psychopath, since I still FEEL stuff, but only when it‚Äôs about me, or things I have an emotional attachment to. I still cry watching sad movies, since I‚Äôd have an attachment to the characters, or something. I‚Äôve also experienced rather depressing thoughts. Once, I was sitting in the car, and my parents were ordering takeout from this restaurant. I suddenly thought about what would happen if my parents were killed in the restaurant, and I‚Äôd be waiting in the car for hours, wonder what would be taking my parents so long. 

I have bad social anxiety, and can‚Äôt handle myself around people. I don‚Äôt have any friends, since friend A and friend B stopped hanging around with me. It‚Äôs not as depressing as it seems, though. I have my phone, computer, and Nintendo switch. What else would I possibly need? People just drag you down, and why would you waste your time on people when they could just as easily be killed? You‚Äôd waste time grieving over your loved ones, and not get anything done! That‚Äôs how people get depressed or something. I‚Äôve just realized I sound like I‚Äôm from some trashy anime, but whatever. What I‚Äôm saying is that I wouldn‚Äôt waste time on making friends, and spend time working, or trying to get somewhere in life. I also hate kids with a burning passion. I think babies are ugly, and toddlers are just downright annoying. When people stormed the capital, I just laughed. I couldn‚Äôt believe we‚Äôve de-evolved this much, and this is what we‚Äôve come to. I was both delighted something like happened, and disgusted at my own species. Apparently it was a tragic experience for some kids, but I just thought it was hilarious that a bunch of trump supporters came and wrecked the place. I realized something was up with my behavior, and that normal people shouldn‚Äôt think like this, but I ignored that. The final straw was when I watched this tornado video, and I just thought it was funny. I was laughing at a traumatic experience that probably scarred people for life, because I just found some lady‚Äôs accent to be funny. How is that normal? My parents are thinking about sending me to get my mental health checked, and I think that may be for the better. I‚Äôve heard that gifted children are more likely to suffer mental illnesses and I feel that may have happened to me. But I‚Äôm still not sure why I‚Äôm this way. Why I don‚Äôt care for other people except for myself. Why I get so nervous when I‚Äôm around people? If anyone thinks they know what I may be going through, your suggestions will be accepted.

2687,"A Liberating Yet Defeating Email  Hey,

I wanted to post the entirety of an email I wrote to my personal therapist/case manager. Some needed info is I was reflecting on the traumatic experience I've had with being held against my will as a 22-year-old adult in a behavioral health unit for 2 weeks in summer 2020( afraid of hospitals now). Also, My family isn't doing too well in family therapy with a different family therapist, I tried for a decade to bring them there, I was always scapegoated as a child and shoved in a room with a therapist. Been going to the same agency since I was 9. My family's unwillingness to change, or look in, and the inexperience of our family therapist( less than a year practicing), combined with my for years now stagnant growth in my personal/family goals, quality of life. I respect my personal therapist/caseworker as a person, and this was 1.5 years coming, a hard email to write.

&#x200B;

"" 

I left you a message about this notification, but I thought I¬†would put this in words.

I would like to keep acquiring my medication through (redacted), and all bare necessities¬†to maintain this. I presume I will need to have a periodic appointment¬†with (redacted), that is fine with me.

I am distrustful of the field and industry of Mental Health. I have been kept against¬†my will, lied to, electrically shocked, force-fed, feigned¬†care, led on, restricted, left adrift with professionals¬†throwing¬†their hands up. I WILL¬†NOT waste my time and energy and emotion just spinning my wheels with little personal progress. I will not do that, let alone feeling on edge with knowing the person I am talking to has little to gain from helping me or not, possibly¬†selling me down the river without a care in how or why they do it, as long as it's approved by peers and employer handbooks.

These professionals¬†are people, and people are garbage. People will lie to make themselves feel confident/assured and to forward their career agendas. People will squeeze the use out of other people, and once their utility is depleted, toss them aside as common litter. People will¬†hurt and assault, torture other people and not ask permission, not ask for forgiveness, ruthlessly tear others apart emotionally, psychologically for the sport of it. Not just the people in the sense of the mental health field.¬† Teachers, peers, employers, family, significant others,

I was the wrong one, this entire time. How stupid and naive of me to think and even believe others can change, or choose to change, or even have insight on who or what or why they are. My futile attempts to improve my life and the world around me are in vain, against the common grain in humanity for sadism, vanity, untruth.¬†

Autistic people like me are targets for the worst of humanity to unload these traits, laugh, torture, control, menace. Humanity, people you trust in abuse it to relieve the stress of their own, and run away when you may inquire about a reason for the slight, hiding behind the wall of ignorance, snickering in the delight of others inability to get answers, and the pure joy of getting away with it.

Some may tell, me,"" So what? That's life.""

I retort,"" What do you know?""

I do not want a session digesting these opinions and choices, I only want one to discuss maintaining my medication regimen if that's on the table.

Best,""

I felt angry writing that. angry not at my caseworker, but at the number of man-hours and ink I have spent and spilled working to better myself but to stagnate as I have no support whatsoever from my family for my aspirations of going to college, becoming a teacher, moving on with my life. I felt angry at that hospital for doing traumatic things to me and not picking up the phone to hear me. I felt angry at how people in my life feign care only to evaporate. I felt angry at how my very DNA predestined me to be miserable and tortured by others, even a rape. I may even go back if I need it, but maybe I need a break?

2688,"Pregabalin and mental health  I've been on 100mg Pregabalin TDS for over a month now (Diagnosis: GAD & Mixed Personality Disorder: BPD with obsessive traits) 

I have noticed some interesting mood changes: 
*Speaking more slowly. People have noticed. I used to talk really fast and sound quite over excitable, and now I talk a bit slower. However, sometimes I can't find the right words to say and struggle to remember the right word, which I have never experienced before commencing the medication. 

*Feeling calmer. Things no longer seem like the end of the world when things don't go to plan or I have a misunderstanding with someone. I simply stay calm and think through what I need to say. I've been learning to take a step back before I say something I don't mean. I've had good feedback from those closest to me that I appear more stable and calmer in myself, and when I communicate with them. 

*Sometimes I feel really flat. It's like my emotions have all been flattened. I'm no longer dancing on the ceiling in delight, and can't say I feel happy even though I tend to come across to people as extremely happy and bubbly at times, particularly at work. However, I don't feel like ending it all or using self harming behaviours for very long either. The feeling passes rather quickly. 

*Impulsivity. The need to do certain impulsive behaviours has increased, however so is my capacity to use logic/wise mind to decide whether or not they are a good idea or not. 

There is a slightly more sinister side though - when things are bad I do feel like jumping off a bridge ( but then I did feel like this before also so may just be me) I do feel quite depressed at times but it is sudden. I was up and down before which is my norm, but now it's like the drop is so steep it makes me feel a bit worried at times. However, I feel MUCH more stable though in general. Before my moods were unmanageable in many situations in my personal life.

*My sleep is much improved. I don't sleep enough (long term habit) however when I do I sleep like a baby, and I actually look forward to my bed. 

*I've noticed that I bite my bottom lip every day now, however I am able to notice it and stop it - it's not involuntary but I do feel a compulsion to do it. I didn't have this before I started this medication and I do seem to move my mouth more than I did before starting the medication which is a slight concern. 

Overall, I would say that it's been life changing for me. I couldn't go on the way I was before, and this medication has allowed me to participate in my DBT programme (which I am just finishing) and make better use of it. It's had no impact on my OCD symptoms, however I am now more aware that I do them than I was before.

I want to know if anyone else has been on Pregabalin, and hear about their experiences.

2689,"Severe depersonalization  The more the days go by, the deeper I sink. I no longer find pleasure in anything; my own existence fills me with anxiety. I am completely numb, with a recurring suicidal idea (slitting my femoral artery in my bathroom). Moreover, I have a phobia of what is called ""magical thinking,"" which is the belief that the mind has the ability to materialize a thought just by thinking about it. But now, I'm afraid that by constantly having this suicidal idea, it will eventually come true, as if it were destined. In fact, I'm gradually becoming phobic of my own mind.  
  
Everything seems unreal, and I no longer recognize myself. I fluctuate between different degrees of unreality throughout the day. Occasionally, I almost regain contact; I feel like I'm reconnecting with life, but it's short-lived.  
  
Metaphysical concepts frighten me, but I can't help but reflect on these subjects, as questions about death and free will horrify me to the core. I have visions, flashes about these topics that strike my soul and shake my consciousness. The concepts of reincarnation and eternal life act upon me like stabs accompanied by a charge of dynamite.  
  
I am here and not here, alternating between hope and despair. I no longer understand what is happening to me. This constant state of reflective consciousness, perceiving the internal processes that animate me. I witness the frenzy of my mind, delighting in fueling my anxieties by creating simulations of consciousness in a body and reality different from mine, in order to test my own abilities to face various types of suffering and, in a way, anticipate the trials I might undergo in another life, to prevent a potential lack of luck in the genetic lottery.  
  
I have a need to express something, an emotional ball felt on my sternum that I have sensed for years without being able to extricate it despite years of deep introspection. I have experienced traumas, but apparently being aware of them and developing my thoughts about them is not enough to emotionally liberate myself.  
  
Perhaps these repressed emotions are the cause of my growing malaise. Honestly, I take some pleasure in suffering, in contemplating the abyss of my own existence, in facing these inner monsters that have been locked away for so long but continue to act in the depths of my being. It's probably my shadow finally showing its face. After all, it's what I wanted. The dragon is now awake. I never thought it would be so imposing and terrifying. My whole being trembles. I am completely destabilized. I wander through the labyrinth of my mind, desperately searching for a source of light. A simple glimmer would suffice. But all I perceive is darkness.  
  
Why live when I'm going to die? Why die when I'm alive? Am I condemned to face this suffering for an indeterminate duration? Moreover, biologically speaking, what logic is there in a living organism retaining its traumas to the point of impairing its normal functioning? Why doesn't this damn body release the emotions I ask it to release? Is it so difficult to make me cry, damn it? No, it's so much more fun to make me suffer without being able to release the pressure! To be imprisoned by my own mind and my own body, and to have only words to reassure myself. By the way, ""my"" implies a ""me,"" and I have no idea where it is or what it looks like. None of this makes any sense.  
  
What I need is a compass. I am lost. I've woven my own web. I am the creator of this labyrinth, but I've lost its plans and allowed the ghosts of my past to intrude.  
  
What I want is a rebirth, to be happy. Actually, no, I don't know. What tells me that true reality isn't the suffering I endure? And if our souls are eternal, why bother with suffering? A little metempsychosis and that's it. A complete reset. If there is nothing after death, is that any better? How do you face the prospect of nothingness?  
  
I want to live and at the same time, I don't. It's as if I am an elementary particle. A constant uncertainty about my state. A fundamental indeterminacy that generates only a fluctuation among an infinity of possible states. Am I reality itself? Is existence itself fractal?  
  
I just returned to the real world after several tens of minutes of writing. Awareness of my existence, of what surrounds me, of my loved ones sleeping. Everything seems so strange, so bizarre. I can't believe I wrote all of this. What I know is that I exist, but it's frightening. Who am I in this vast universe? Just a mere sack of flesh and bones that is aware of itself and condemned to endure the suffering predetermined for it by determinism? What kind of horrible universe is this?  
  
I project my own state of mind onto others, so inevitably I see them as I currently see myself: strange and devoid of meaning. No one seems truly real. Perhaps, no one exists around me. This solipsistic view is horrifying and incredibly distressing. Just as distressing is the scientific view that sees us as complex machines functioning through stimuli, hormones, and cells, with no control over anything. By the way, how is it possible for people to firmly believe that we do not possess free will? Besides trying to appear intellectual, I see no other explanations.  
  
No theories seem to hold up. The more it goes on, the more I think that life is just a big joke, and the punchline will be revealed after we die. We push a rock up a hill because, in any case, we have nothing better to do. It's all just a big joke. Haha, we laugh so damn hard. Maybe we're just a carambar joke for beings in the fourth spatial dimension. Or maybe a TV program where each of us is a movie in itself. And these beings could choose who to watch. So, the purpose of life would be to attract as many 4D spectators as possible to feed off their energy?  
  
I haven't taken any drugs. However, I'm starting to seriously doubt my mental health. Although deep down, I realize that not understanding is not a serious problem. After all, I'm not obliged to identify with this incomprehension.  
  
This message has gone far beyond what I initially wanted to say. But if we were to summarize, I'm not doing well, and I would like to reconnect with reality. I'm going to have a session of bio-kinergy. Chakras and all that stuff resonate with me. I can relate to the symptoms of a closed third chakra. I never thought I would be interested in this subject one day. But now, I'm starting to feel overwhelmed. I see a psychiatrist, but inhibiting my symptoms with medication won't remove the fact that I have unexpressed emotional baggage. It will give me the illusion of not having it, and I don't like that. Maybe this attitude is just a result of self-destructive behavior induced by my past traumas. How do I know who to believe in the end? Science or spirituality?  
  
I'm very afraid of remaining stuck with this veil between me (whoever I am) and reality.",Relaxed
2690,"My Experience of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: is it Normal?  EDIT: Should probably add I'm in the UK.

I started (and ended) CBT some months ago. I was only allotted a block of 3 hours in total, split into 30 minute sessions.
I don't think either of these limits were helpful, as they added pressure and anxiety to the whole situation.

The therapist did a lot to let me take the lead and decide on my own treatment, and while I appreciated that, I was only there because I didn't know what to do. While I don't think he should have just dragged me where he thought was best, I would have appreciated a guiding hand (or at least a couple of fingers).

In particular, when asked to define what I considered to be my main problem, I simply spewed out every issue I could think of.
Depression, anxiety, insecurity, social ineptitude, low self-esteem and probably several things more. I didn't know, nor did I receive any indication, if this was a an appropriate problem-scope for only 3 hours of therapy. In hindsight, I can say with confidence that it was too much and too broad, and could well have been better had I been more specific.

In general, in fact, I found myself rambling a lot, I tried to make notes to help me but it was difficult to plan what to talk about before sessions.

The therapist gave me exercises to do, mostly written exercises and recording my thoughts and behaviours. I think a lot of these were good and some of them really helped (others didn't more on that shortly). What I thought less of was the stream of published self-help material that came my way. I tried that sort of thing before coming to therapy and it didn't do much, I got a therapist because I felt that doing things by myself wasn't helping.

The plurality (possibly even majority) of the 3 hours was given over to anxiety, and I saw a reasonable improvement in that area.
It was the anxiety related exercises that worked the best because we had time to practise them together and iterate (analyse my work and point out ways to improve in subsequent sessions). I think having more 1-1 time in general would have helped.

Being honest, though, I feel I could have tried harder with the exercises that we didn't have time to go through together (mostly focused on depression, low self-esteem and other delightful members of that family). I felt a little out of my depth, but I could have kept them up for longer even without feedback. I feel it is likely that I went to therapy for someone to talk to, rather than the exercises.

I feel I've focused a lot on the negative here, so I should also say that I feel it was helpful overall, especially with anxiety and that I do not regret going. I want to know, though, if these are typical experiences and if I can find better ones... or at least, a paradigm that suits me better.

Thanks if you got this far :)

2691,"Lost in Translation - Saying Goodbye to Travel Friends  I've lived in Spain for a while and returned this sunday. The majority of my stay I felt very isolated, lonely, sad. I didnt want to do anything, after work I would just lay depressed in my bed instead of exploring the city and making as much out of my stay as possible. I lived with 6 italians in an international Dorm, but since they were all an established group of friends and spoke the same language, they didnt bother to include me (yes, I tried many times to be open to them, to invite them to do something with me etc, but they genuinely didnt care about me. So whatever, I stopped trying) Funny thing is that all of my work colleagues back at home thought I had the time of my life, but just because you're living abroad doesn't guarantee you a ticket into a sorrowless life - you carry your problems with your luggage.

The best part of my days, however, had been my work. I worked with 2 other young spanish people in a Media Bureau, we did CGI & Video Editing. Those two were such delightful people, every day I would look forward to see them for the short period of time we would work together. They were so open-hearted, kind, warm, wonderful people and we got along great. They were cousins, a girl (M) and a guy (C), both at the beginning of 20, just like me.
Every day after work, I wanted to ask them if they wanted to hang out after work, but I didn't build up the courage. So weeks went by, me being frustrated at myself every day because I didn't build up the courage to ask them. But one and a half weeks prior to my departure back to my home I finally asked them, and they said yes! 
Turns out they were contemplating the same thing the whole time.

Like I said, the majority of my stay was pretty shitty, but when we started hanging out, everything changed. We started a WhatsApp group and texted in there the entire time, we went out and had dinner together, went to the mall, they showed me their home town, we went to a pub, to the pizza place C worked at, we ate Mexican food together... we had such a blast together! M even payed for all the pizza and drinks without telling us because she simply wanted to. We genuinely enjoyed eachothers company and wanted to do good for the others. Fighting on who pays for the food because everyone wanted to pay was a common thing.

I was so happy that I have finally found real friends abroad, and to be honest, it has been such a long time since I had such meaningful relationships, or any kind of friendship in general. This was one if not the most intense relationship I have ever had with people in my life.

Then the day came we had to say goodbye. It was so heartbreaking for me, I was about to cry the whole day. We went to a Mexican place after work for one last time, talking and laughing together. Then I had to go to a meeting, having to say goodbye to them. We hugged each other and they told me that they miss me already and what a wonderful person I am. I returned the same, at the verge of crying. I told them that I was so thankful to know them and that they are truly special people. And with that we left each other's lives. 

Now that I'm back in Germany, I don't want to stay here. I am so alone here, and having had such a blossoming relationship for such a short time doesn't seem fair to me. I heavily gravitate towards the movie ""Lost in Translation"", because it perfectly sums up my life feeling of loneliness and isolation. But also, I tend to make more friends abroad than back at home, so its always so painful to say goodbye. It feels like I'm not made for long lasting relationships, only small snippets that leave me wanting more.",Relaxed
2692,"I hurt all the time.  My name is Aaron (22M). Like the title says, I‚Äôm really just in pain and hurt all the time. I‚Äôve never posted something like this before, let alone vent and type out coming up to two decades worth of hurt. I don‚Äôt know where to start other than when I was little.

I have always had very early memories and recollections as a young kid, maybe 4 at the earliest, where I can recall feeling what I‚Äôve always felt to now- my adult life. My childhood was rather average. Good family, bigger than most, devout believers of their faith, hardworking, family was important. I have 4 siblings. When me and my twin sister were born, there was 12-16 years of age difference between us and our older 2 sisters and brother.
They all moved out when I was younger, long before I was able to make meaningful relationships with them being a child and them being young adults and starting life. 

  Going back to when I was 4, I‚Äôve always felt a very pervasive sense of loneliness and experienced literal loneliness, senses impending doom, sadness and a very harsh feeling of disconnection from people and the world that still persist today with a multitude of other things. I was bullied quite often growing up in school. Constant teasing, ostracizing, intimidation, shaming and always labelled and kept from expressing anything. Never trusted, or picked with delight for something, more so the last option in a bucket. The times I spoke up for help or because it was getting to be too much it was never met with resolve. The same things kept happening, the same people got away with their antics and the same punishment was endured relatively everyday by myself. I can still remember hiding in stalls in locker rooms in gym class to just hope to be left alone. The same guys then we‚Äôre the same ones who cornered me in a basement closest at a kids birthday party (former childhood friends) when we we‚Äôre 7 or 8 and yelled and shoved me around yelling sexual explicits and making fun of me and my body and refusing to let me leave. Even the friends parents wouldn‚Äôt believe me when I was eventually able to tell them and wouldn‚Äôt let me phone home to leave. Being the kid from the religious family also didn‚Äôt bring any less heat or source for their new ways to hurt me. 

  Making friends was always so hard and still is hard. Even when I played sports and trained heavily, I was still met with the same awful days as I experienced in grade school into high school. There is when things really made my mental health dive deep into hell. High school was and still is one of the most unbelievably lonely and and hard times I‚Äôve gone through. No amount of exercise, training, art ( used to draw a lot), or much reduced, helped, or alleviated anything. Couldn‚Äôt against the amount of isolation and disregard my existence had there.
I have a few friends but my constant experience and feeling is I‚Äôm more of just a background friend. I feel more of an afterthought. With everyone. All my siblings are older and married, some with kids, even my twin sister is married. All of them have really not taken much interest in my life. Not that my life really has much going on to talk about.

  Sitting on my bed this morning getting out to go do work I just sat there like the many times I have before and just not know what to do with the day. So it can just be done. So I can just be alone and away. I hurt and hurt and hurt all the time. There is almost never a moment when I can just not be in pain or losing myself inside my head. I fantasize in so much anger and violence, I want connections so I can feel normal, but the realities case just says no. The constant anxiety and depression, impending doom, the anger, the boredom, the loneliness, the emptiness, no matter what I‚Äôve tried over the years, if I try to put good into it, with something to try and help me it just brings nothing to me all while feeling so much care and concern for people and a world that i just simply don‚Äôt believe would do the same for me. I saw someone post here about the first 30 seconds of waking up to be the only time of a sense of calm before the anxiety sets back in. I don‚Äôt even get that anymore. 

All I feel is cold .. numb.. and apathetic. I am simply just not functioning anymore. I don‚Äôt know how to believe others feel what I‚Äôm feeling. I really don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to. My constant survival mode is working slower and slower and the point of it all has left me long, long ago. I simply just hurt all the time.",Relaxed
2693,"Hope is inside. Go deep.  
¬†I think it may be true that most moments of clarity I cultivate happen during times when I'm truly present. If I'm being present, it's very difficult to deny the unresolved pain I sit with moment to moment. In those moments, I am both present and living in the past. The pain never stopped being pain. The pain never really forgot its origins. And the pain was continuously compounded by misdirected decisions influenced by its very presence. Might be part of the reason I try to avoid being present.¬†

¬† In any given moment there are multitudes of things I can be aware of. Sights, sounds, smells, touch... and the big one, feelings... Within my internal physical biology, there are¬† many things happening as well. My body is busily going about regulating the myriad of systems working within it. From digestion to my perception, it's all working together to ensure I have the ability to be present. Just so I can experience this moment,¬† while in¬† anticipation of another. And another.¬†

Layers, man. Layers.¬†

How do I nurture that part of me that is moored in a past whose future never came to be? How do I reeducate my subconscious whose misguided lessons were set in stone so long ago? I cannot go back in time and reraise myself. Right?

Or, can I?

That's really what I've been doing.¬†

The term 'inner child' makes me recoil. I hate it. Why?¬†

Because I hate me. Kind of.

Layers.¬†

When I was a toddler, I designed a narrative around my identity that dictates that I'm a piece of shit. That is my core identity. Or so my subconscious believes.¬†

It's not true.¬†

The truth is,  my brain couldn't develop as it should have due to trauma and emotional neglect. The truth is, I'm a fucking badass. The proof is,  I'm present to write this. I made it. I fucking made it. With a deck stacked heartily against me, I persevered.¬†

The more clarity I cultivate, the more apparent to me it is that I'm an exceptional human being. The more apparent it is that I was really freakin screwed up. I mean, really screwed up. And, I'm still here.¬†

Right now.¬†

Writing this. 49 years after my birth. 45 years after my original trauma.¬†

I've been fortunate to have support over all these years. However, that support would have meant nothing had I given up. I chose to allow other's assistance. It was my choice to reach out and then respond.¬†

I, actually, did give up. 3 times. When I was 17, 33, and again when I was 45. I've survived 3 suicide attempts. The last one was the most important.¬†

I was engaged with the act of ending it all in the fall of 2017, but the methodology I chose was slow. It gave me time to reflect,¬†once my decision had been made. The method I chose would have taken several days, but I changed my mind before suffering any lasting physical damage. I can't know for certain, but I'm pretty sure that was my final attempt. Won't be doing that again.¬†

Why?¬†

Because I'm changing my brain. And, I'm learning to love me.

How?¬†

Dedication to wellness. Therapy. Willingness to do the crazy hard work of unpacking my crazy. Medicine. (Psylocibin specifically). And a willingness to toy with the idea that I'm not a piece of shit.¬†

The progress seems painfully slow, at times. Others, and more rarely, I rocket forward with breakthroughs. These massive breakthroughs are very difficult to manage. They tend to fire up my mania. However, because of the progress I've made, I'm able to avoid sitting down in that particular roller coaster cart, so far. ¬†

""Go slowly into the light"", a dear friend told me not too long ago. He was correct. The light's super hot if I go too fast. It burns from the inside. It's both empowering and nerve rattling. Too much stimulus. 
I wanted to share this especially with those of you who are really young and can't see a future not filled with pain, misery and powerlessness. There's hope. Those of us with psychological challenges have a powerful inner strength that comes from enduring the onslaught we, and the world, subject us to. I lived in a constant state of flight, fight, or freeze for decades. That's constitution. That's strength. That's perseverance. We all, until we can't, endure this adversity day in and day out.

Heroes.¬†

Every single one of us. Heroes.¬†

When we can no longer endure, there are often terrible tragedies. Suicides and murders. Crimes of passion.¬†

If you should find yourself in a place where you just can't do it anymore, please pause. Go inside yourself and find the mind and heart within you that is biologically stuck in the past. Hold your subconscious with tenderness and understanding. That part of you that is trying to protect you, but is misguided. If you are suffering, deep down inside you is a solution that's not violent or dangerous. It's obscured, perhaps, but it's there. It's the psyche of a scared and overwhelmed person for whom there were not enough tools. Give 'em the tools. Then guide yourself to wellness.¬†

The tools?¬†

Compassion, understanding, honesty, love...

Really.¬†

It certainly didn't happen overnight for me. I started this work 5 years ago. Today, right now, in this moment, I'm at peace. What a deliciously delightful peace it is.¬†

Love to you all.

Go slowly into the light. Savor it. You deserve all good things.¬†",Relaxed
2694,"I am Tired  I am Me, I have been on this ‚Äújourney‚Äù for 25 years and I'm so very tired. 

I am certain I have made this trip so many times before, I grow weary and my energy is constantly draining, but I know I must go on. At the beginning of this journey I was conditioned to think that if I was to end my journey too soon I will be burned for an eternity, this bothers me greatly. However a tale of grand place where all hopes and dreams come true was also told to me, alas I do not believe this to be true. I have seen so much to know this place likely does not exist yet its counterpart likely does, and knowing this instils a fear in me that I wish I could remove, however I cannot, so I am bound to travel this road forever hoping the end will come and I can rest.

It seems so long ago that I actually enjoyed this trip, some 11 years ago. Around that time I was ‚ÄúHappy‚Äù and ‚ÄúFit‚Äù ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù and all that other ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù stuff I have been taught I should be. However my eyes were opening and this trip was not what it seemed, I developed  some thoughts and ideas that I could not let go, one question in particular ‚ÄúWhat's the point?‚Äù, this question puzzles me even to this day, it haunts me, it leeches away at my very soul, I know that no matter what sort of person I am, whether I'm rich or poor, fat or thin, ‚ÄúGood‚Äù or ‚ÄúBad‚Äù it does not matter in the slightest, time will once again end my journey regardless of how I have lived, thus removing any thought of self preservation, social needs, willingness to comply to utter nonsense, tolerance for other travellers.

I have come across many travellers in my time, and as of late I have stumbled upon some older ones whom I occupy a office space with. I sit there wasting my time away working to make another person richer, even though it will make no difference in the long run, and I hear these travellers obsess over such trivial stuff, they obsess over the colour of their hair and nails, what they are going to do now its raining and many more trivial things. It infuriates me, I can not take listening to such trivial woes of a middle class traveller. However these travellers are a delight compared to the ‚ÄúDrones‚Äù the travellers that obey and do anything and everything someone who has claimed ‚Äúpower‚Äù demands. These travellers have no original thoughts, do not question anything and yet they seem so happy with the way things are. Is this the way it should be? Pretend I am a Sheep and just go on the same journey as other travellers?

I am so very tired, this journey is not the one for me, I feel as though I've done this too many times. I need a rest. I am purposelessly trying to reduce my journey time by not conforming to the ‚ÄúEat well and exercise‚Äù regiment in place. However this seems to have no other effect as of yet except I seem to have acquired more fat. I see travellers frantically trying to extend their journey times, I see travellers who get the cancer and recover and I envy them, I wish nature would activate its kill command on me so I could refuse the treatment and finally set the end point to this journey. But it is not so simple, nothing really matters does it? I could go on doing what I'm currently doing on this journey and more than likely my journey will go on much longer than other travellers who have fought so hard to postpone arriving at the end.

I am not a ‚ÄúBad‚Äù traveller, I share what little I have, I share what knowledge I have and I do my utmost best to comfort and make other travellers ‚ÄúHappy‚Äù, but I'm so very tired.

I will pull into the services now, and gaze upon the Milky Way, for it is here that I feel most at peace, this is where I belong and I so long to go to sleep and return.

2695,"Help Needed  Hello I need some help... it‚Äôs a very long story but I will try and tell you all as much as I can . I suffer with BPD ( I think Autism ( but not been diagnosed) and I suspect Learning Difficulties) I live in a house with my Landlord he lives downstairs and I have the attic. Not of the time things are ok but he daily makes fun of my Mental Health calling me a Cabbage / Thick Cunt / Brain Dead etc Now with my illness I can do things wrong and get things the wrong way round like yesterday he decided to get a bath when he knew the Doctor was calling and low and behold they rang when he was in the bath so asked me to answer it and I‚Äôm not use to his phone so I accidentally switched the call off so he erupted calling me a useless fucker etc and can become violent. With my illness I cannot properly absorb information and I also get mixed up with my left and right I have no sense of time so if I go out sometimes I loose track and I get accused of being with people I shouldn‚Äôt. Rewind a few years I was a Heroin Addict and I was abused and controlled by a older man for nearly 10 years he would make me do things with him so I could fund my habit I‚Äôm not proud of it I‚Äôm utterly ashamed. I also lost my Soul Mate who I lost in 2015 and it utterly destroyed me ( the man controlling me was before I was with this man) and because of my past addiction to drugs my partner‚Äôs family wouldn‚Äôt let me go to his funeral and I don‚Äôt even know where his ashes have been scattered even though I‚Äôve been clean from Heroin nearly 8 years. So when this happened I let myself go and got addicted to Crack Cocaine to the point it nearly killed me. When I became friends with my Landlord he said he saw a good person in me which is why he let me rent a room. Everyday I get told how useless and worthless I am and what a old whore I am and that nobody likes me etc he makes out that I‚Äôm far worse than I actually am
He says I am nosey and that I say inappropriate things such as Example: If I‚Äôm talking to someone I know and I say something like ‚Äú Are you still living such and such he tells me to stop being nosey and that it‚Äôs inappropriate to say something like that which I suppose it is to someone you don‚Äôt know but if it‚Äôs someone your friends with I personally don‚Äôt see the problem. There are too many things he says I do and tells people such as neighbours my personal business but when I bring it up he tells me to F off and that he is defending himself. He has this girl ( a friend who has started coming coming round and I have tried my hardest to be nice to this girl and she has gotten herself a bf now so we didn‚Äôt see her for a while but the last time before the break in seeing her she always forgot her baccy and would come to ours because she knew I smoked and I found some baccy in the back of the Cutlery drawer that he had put there for her but when I asked him he replied I must have done it and that I probably couldn‚Äôt remember doing it because I did have episodes where I would have periods where I forgot things but I know 100% I didn‚Äôt do it . Then she came round last week after not seeing her for months and I had a box of Omprozole tablets and they have suddenly gone missing and I‚Äôm pretty sure that either he has put them with his own medication or he has given them to this girl but when I brought it up he said it was me and that I would of put them somewhere and that it‚Äôs my head that goes and not his but I know they have disappeared. Also I tried to be friendly with this girl and was sat telling her how bad my illness gets and her and my landlord are sat there smerking at each other like it‚Äôs a laugh and he knows more than anyone how I suffer...so I go out to make a cuppa and he is there telling her how thick I am and that I don‚Äôt know my left from right and it‚Äôs like babysitting a 14yr old girl but when I complained about it he told me he has to defend himself and that I‚Äôm nothing but a Thick useless cunt.
My mental health bothers me more than anything I know I have a lot wrong with me but everyday I just feel worse. I‚Äôve come off Heroin and also Pregablin I was on 900ml a day then I was on 60mil of Methadone and I‚Äôm only on 36ml I have done soo much to try and help myself. He tells me to go and kill myself that no one likes me so just go and do it. Today I went to meet a friend for a coffee and at left Tesco at 11.30 and while I was there I was told by someone that Costa were selling there drinks for 50p because it was their 50th Birthday so I thought it‚Äôs only over the road so will go and get one and take it home so I‚Äôm walking home and realise I need tobacco so had to go back and get it from the garage cos if I had of gone home and said ‚Äú Oh I forgot to get my tobacco he would of gone mad and say it was just an excuse to go out again. So while I was doing that he had phoned my friend and she said that we had parted ways in tesco so when I got home the door was locked so I had to knock and when he answered he said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it your gone I‚Äôm not sitting here babysitting you . I bet you went ti Costa to see i who you knew over there calling me all the names under the sun and I just feel completely bullied and I told him that and he told me to shut up or would throw me on the street there and then.I do a lot for him I look after his Grandaughter I treat her as my own but I get no thanks just get told no wonder I get on with her cos we are the same age. I am not great with money and I have my benefit paid in to his account now if I leave he has told me I go with nothing and that he will say he needs to replace carpets etc he makes my life sheer hell and it‚Äôs ok for people to say find somewhere else but it‚Äôs not that that easy although I have my name down for supported housing. As for my money it‚Äôs like this if I leave I go with nothing ... I‚Äôve been to the police once before who have told me because I willingly have my benefit paid in to his account they won‚Äôt interfere and that they class it as a civil matter and that it‚Äôs up to me to take Him to a small claims court. He has great great delight in watching me suffer he would love to see me struggling and get back in to my old life. There is much much more but I just need some help I can‚Äôt talk to him coz I just get abused he calls me ugly and really hurtful things and could cut anyone in pieces with his tongue he can be pure evil. Thankyou hope someone can advise me how to stand up to him because I walk on eggshells everyday if I do anything wrong I‚Äôm in for it. Thanks Again",Relaxed
2696,"My Childhood Mental Mishaps   Not sure if this belongs here. This is a throwaway account due to unrelated reasons. 

&#x200B;

 My mental mishaps start around the time I was in 5th grade, when my parents got divorced. My parents gave the normal talk about how they still loved us and wasn't our fault, that they just didn't love each other anymore and thought is was best to spend some time apart. As this was announced my sister did not cry, she just sat there quietly which I would later find out was her way of suppressing the emotions for later. I on the other hand had tears streaming down my face every drop causing me to go farther down into a pit of emotions. Though after that first spirt of emotions I just took them all and locked them away and box in a drawer which was in a desk in a safe and I left. 

 So, life went on and I moved out of my childhood home a rather large house with a big backyard into my dad's new small rental house with these odd teekies in the front yard, while my mother figured out where she would buy a new house. When I walked into my dad's house for the first time I was surprised, though not in a good way. There were boxes everywhere with all his junk in it along with an empty kitchen with a smelly old pantry and janky fridge (both were empty). After seeing that I thought it couldn't get worse I mean my bedroom can't be that bad. I walked over to my room and all that was there was a twin bed and empty white space that felt as if it hadn't been touched for centuries. The next week I came home from a visit to my mom to see that twin bed gone replaced with a bunk bed with only a top bunk and underneath there was a carpet, bean bag, tv mounted to the wall, and best of all an Xbox. I ran down the hall to my father thanking him profusely where he just smiled and said, ""Thomas and I picked this stuff up while you were gone because we thought your room seemed a little dull."" My delight would soon turn to sadness. My sister came home from school and all she did was yell at me and with pure hatred in her eyes she ripped my tv off the wall and let it fall to the ground. I never found out why she did such a thing, but I think she was angry that she didn't get a tv.

 Not much went on at my mom's new place. By the time she got her house I was used to a small house and was not surprised when I saw it. My sister didn't act up at that house ,so at least I felt safe from a constant onslaught of words there with my mother shielding me from her hate taking it on all by herself. Since then I have always hated myself for not even lifting a finger trying to help the situation, but at the time I didn't understand or even know how to deal with a situation like that. 

 Fast-forward a year and my dad has a house of his own. He is a very well off man making upwards of 6 digits a year. The house he bought was in the most expensive neighborhood in Austin. I loved the new house, but as time went on my sister fell into a deep hole of drugs and anger while I retained mental damage from her as my father went through a midlife crises. When my father was going through this change he seemed to forget I existed along with my sister. First a regular supply of food stopped coming, then dinner stopped coming completely as well as breakfast. I would only have lunch at school that he made for me because he had to keep his public image up. The only time I would ever get dinner was when he brought home guests and once again he had to keep his public image safe, so he made dinner and acknowledged that I existed. I would be forced to put on an act for his new friends because in my head I thought there wouldn't be any lunch if I didn't act like a normal kid. I especially couldn't have the school lunches because I was almost deathly allergic to wheat and dairy which is in everything. Eventually he started giving my sister his credit card so that we could go shopping and get food for ourselves. I was a kid, so all I did was buy junk food that I would eat in massive amounts causing me to develop an eating disorder where I would constantly eat. Even today I am still stuck in that loop of eating and eating and eating. The mental issues with the tension of home life just kept building and building on itself and those emotions that I locked away, so long ago started seeping out until the safe blew open overloaded with emotions and mental stress. So, I went further into that pit that had now turned into a black hole eating up everything in sight. I was sent into deep depression which I'm still enveloped in, even now.

 The year is now 2019 and I'm still suffering from all these issues and mental stress that keeps building up. I am currently only 15, so I still have more time stuck in this place, but when I get out I hope my life can change for the better.",Relaxed
2697,"My diary entry from today about the shame/insecurity/spotlight effect/obsessingthat causes me so much pain...  (I got a second job at cafe because I am working to get debt free so I can leave this place and travel. i was working at another PT gig in customer service before this one but left because it was toxic. This place is customer service too which means it has the same pitfalls for me emotionally, but all in all is a pretty amazing PT job so I'm not keen on just quitting to avoid the difficulty)

Had some clarity today on something that causes me intense pain and suffering.
It‚Äôs something that I need to ‚Äúsuss out‚Äù so I can finally figure out how reduce it‚Äôs strangle hold over me.
It‚Äôs the constant insecurity, especially while working at the caf√© (and also what I felt while working at the burger joint). The constant feeling like I‚Äôm brutally socially awkward and that customers can sense this. It‚Äôs not just that. It‚Äôs that I am sure that some of them laugh at me, smirk to themselves and their friends and make little barbed comments when they walk away from the til. I worry that I have a reputation as ‚Äúthat brutally awkward over sensitive weirdo who can‚Äôt get anything right‚Äù.
 I feel like some of the customers are picking me apart, judging things about me and delighting in viewing me as an inferior being. It guts me, it infuriates me. I obsess over instances with customers that were difficult, i.e- a customer had a knowing smile on their face while talking to me or at the end of our interaction as if I had done something horribly embarrassing. One guy made weirdly intense eye contact while smirking at me, it was like he was  trying to stare me down. One of the insecurities I have is around eye contact and I worry that the story some customers have who have interacted with me before is that I‚Äôm somehow trying to dominate people with my eye contact when all I‚Äôm ever trying to do is practice ‚Äúnatural‚Äù feeling eye contact. I‚Äôm sorta big and fairly heavily tattooed so I think some people might actually assume that I think I‚Äôm a tough guy or something, when really I‚Äôm quite insecure and struggling to just be natural and not be full of shame.
I feel like a big, messy, infected, open wound. I feel like people can see right through me. I feel like I can‚Äôt get things right. It eats me alive. I worry that there are people who think of me as a loser, a pathetic, awkward, weirdo who‚Äôs creepy and stupid. The thing is, based on the way some people treat me, I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs true. I know that much of that insecurity is in my head, that I‚Äôm just misinterpreting signals and thinking things are all about me. I know that‚Äôs a common cognitive distortion, the spotlight effect, and that it‚Äôs definitely at play here to some degree. (ok, to a large degree). But I also know that I come across as insecure. I get flush and start sweating very easily. I am on edge and make mistakes. I‚Äôm absent minded and it causes problems during rushes. But the level of  shame and insecurity I feel is so insanely disproportionate to anything I‚Äôve done wrong and I can‚Äôt bear it anymore. I can‚Äôt stand taking my work home with me when there is no reason too. I can‚Äôt stand having so many painful memories of embarrassments from today, yesterday, and almost every day before that dominate so much of my thoughts. 
Writing about it now, breaking it down, makes it obvious how silly and illogical and wasteful it is to care so much about what other people think or are doing, or what I think they are thinking or doing.
Obviously if I‚Äôm dealing with a few hundred customers a day some of them will be weird with me and it will be because of their own crap and not something I did. Even if I do something embarrassing or absent minded that somehow affects them in some minorly negative way (you got my drink order wrong, YOU ruined my whaaaaaaaaaaa) then it says more about them than it does about me if they need to shit on me for that innocent mistake.
I worked another customer service job before this one and it was the same shit. I don‚Äôt want to quit because I want/need the extra money to achieve some goals, it gives me a social outlet and something to do, and I‚Äôm learning a lot in this job, and I know that my experience will be the same wherever I go so running away isn‚Äôt the answer, I‚Äôve done that plenty in my life and it‚Äôs gotten me nowhere (not denying that sometimes it‚Äôs healthy to remove yourself from difficult situations, but in this case it‚Äôs not the best option for me).
Ohhh shame. Oh insecurity. Oh obsession. I‚Äôm going to die one day and I‚Äôm worried because some jerks like to make other people feel tiny and I let them do it to me, or, I‚Äôm worried because I imagine other people are doing things to make me feel tiny (probably a bit of both is happening).

2698,"Celebrating My One Year Anniversary Of Starting My Mental Health Program  One year ago yesterday I (F, 30, 29 during the story) ) started what would be the most emotionally intensive ten weeks of my life. The first two weeks it was just me as I was the first adult patient in the brand new program. There was one teen girl for the adolescent program the first day but she was quickly joined by other teens. The teens had their program in other rooms across the small facility. I only saw them in between sessions and during lunch where they chatted and gossipped amongst themselves while I quietly observed from the couch or the puzzle table. I quickly bonded with a quiet but moody boy who had a fantastic drawing talent and could create realistic portraits on the thirty minutes we got for lunch. I hope he continues to pursue his art. I feel like he could really go places.
 
Those two weeks I endured intensive one on one therapy sessions for six hours a day, switching between four of the five staff whom I came to adore and admire for different reasons. T was the program director but tried hard to be relatable with all the patients. My intake was with her and K, my actual assigned therapist. She was a certified art therapist which worked well to provide me a creative outlet with someone who could help relate to the work I was doing on the program. She was great at interpreting my art and helping me understand how it relayed to my trauma. She had no patience for the kids though and being very pregnant, the stress of a new program weighed heavily on her. She was only a year or two older than me and sometimes I found myself intimidated by the vast differences between our situations but I appreciated her all the same.
 
A was the other main therapist there and was so very sweet. She was also young but she was great with the kids. She was quiet but firm and they respected her in ways they didn't with the others.
 
H was by favorite but she ended up leaving before my ten weeks were over. She was Haitian but grew up in England and had a delightful accent that was a blend of the two countries she loved. She broke her leg two weeks before the start of the program but she still managed to show up everyday with a good attitude. I will admit, there were some sessions we just sat and chatted and didn't do much therapy but honestly, some of those heart to hearts were the most beneficial of the whole program. 
 
H had some personal issues that came up and unfortunately had to put in her resignation but she and I are now Facebook friends (I looked her up) and she offers me words of encouragement from time to time. She was the person who really believed in my art for the first time, encouraging me to express myself in art rather than words. My ex husband took away my love for writing and I am working very hard to get it back but it is a slow process. Art has become my creative outlet and therapeutic tool in its place and I have this program to thank. This is the longest personal writing I have attempted since I left him and I thank you all for letting me use this excuse to do so. 
 
 Y came later from the residency program I refused to go to when I was first evaluated. She was the tech and was crazy about concerts which was convenient because the big local concert stadium sat across the street. Pitbull even played there towards the end of my stay at the program. There was also a psychiatrist who came once a week and his only job was to monitor our medications. He immediately declared that my psychiatrist of a year was giving me all wrong medications and switched up my prescriptions from mostly antidepressants to antipsychotixs which led me have some unpleasant fogginess and general zombieness. When I left the program, my psychiatrist scoffed at his recommendations and made me switch as soon as she deemed it safe. 
 
Those first two weeks it was just me for six hours a day and it was exhausting. I was majorly depressed and a suicide risk and didn't want to have to sit and have therapy for six hours by myself but I had already jumped through all the hoops with work to be able to work only four hours a day with the rest being covered by disability. My manager and team lead, main clients and HR were aware of my spiraling mental state and there was no way I could face them having done less than two weeks of a 4-6 week (I was told initially) programmental health program. Despite being ""partially hospitalized"" I was free to quit whenever I wanted. In fact, one girl ran away and H refused to go after her.
 
""Let her go!"" she huffed. ""There's no way I'm chasing her with a broken leg. They don't pay me enough.""
 
Still, my pride refused to let me quit. I'm glad I didn't, but at the time I couldn't see how those two weeks were a secret blessing as without those intensive one on one sessions, I may not have healed the same way. 
 
Week three, R joined me. He was in his fifties and was there for anger management. He was always super cryptic with the details of what led his job to ""volun-tell"" him to go, but it had something to do with his temper. He ended up being the sweetest guy, quiet but after a week or two was actively participating. He had a collection of face mask scarves (I don't remember what they are actually called) from all the national stay parks and they had mountains and maps on them and he was very proud of them.
 
N came a week after R. He was trans but hadn't transitioned yet and poor H had the hardest time remembering his pronouns to the point where he complained to T. N and I clicked immediately being close to the same age and into the same nerdy things. When I left was the middle of Ren Fest season and he even gave me his very nice dress for me to have since he was not going to wear it.
 
""I want it to go to someone who will love it,"" he said when we did our final goodbye hugs.
 
The program was far from perfect. Group family therapy hardly ever happened because schedules or technology got in the way. As my assigned therapist, K was supposed to handle my personal family therapy and because I didn't feel comfortable with my parents knowing about my going to the program and I was closer with my poly couple I was with at the time (whom I still live with and consider family. Life is complicated and housing is expensive.), I had them attend family therapy with me but K was not really prepared for that kind of dynamic and when I transitioned from PHP to IOP, the family therapy sessions just stopped, no transition, no ending exercises, nothing.
 
They were also understaffed and with H having to take time off and eventually leave, they were strapped thin even when Y got added on. The program is actually nationwide, but this was the first one opened up in our state. It was based out of California and the tream over there was awful. I actually ended up attending with the amount my insurance wouldn't pay completely comped because they messed up my on-boarding so badly.
 
Still, that time in the program, ten weeks in total, (6 weeks PHP and 4 weeks IOP) was beneficial in ways I still am discovering. I was able to find hope in life again. It was months before I felt the urge to self harm and at that point, I had the tools I needed to keep myself safe. I now paint or draw nearly everyday becsuseand it helps give my brain a way to break away from all the noise in my head. I can process my husband's abuse and imprisonment in healthy ways. I have a long long way to go, but my therapist is fantastic and is one of my biggest supporters.
 
I guess all I'm saying is, don't let the stigma of mental health programs keep you from getting the help you need. I almost did and I don't think I would be here today if I didn't allow myself to be vulnerable and get the helo I needed.",Relaxed
2699,"My year in psychosis: age 31 (a long read)  Some time around this time last year I posted in r/datingoverthirty a sort of recounting of my year, and how dating had gone for me. A lot of people were pretty kind about it, and some people weren't so much, but I loved writing it. This year has been totally different for everyone, and actually, the recounting of my year belongs more in this subreddit than it does in the other.

My first encounter with mental health services in the UK was when I was around 16/17 years old. I remember going to the GP with my friend because I was too scared to go alone, and crying in the doctors office. I was prescribed anti-depressants, and referred to psychiatry for evaluation. I remember that I wasn't diagnosed with anything, but that I was offered counselling for a period of time.

I took the counselling, which had always been difficult to do, because I didn't feel like I had anywhere private to talk to the counsellor. I remember talking with him, Johnathan, the counsellor, in his car, in a supermarket cafe, in my Grandma's living room while she spent time in the kitchen. I don't know if it was valuable to me at the time, but in hindsight, I don't remember anything that I had talked to him about except a boy I was in love with - RH. I told Johnathan that RH was better than me, and not many people were. Things for me and RH didn't go so well. He was very academic, and I'd failed all of my exams. He left our hometown, and I stayed there. I was always scared that it would happen, but deep down knew that it was inevitable.

After that I took an interest in philosophy, and when I had some money of my own, aged 22/23,I elected to see a private existential therapist, John. John was actually great, and I always enjoyed talking to him. Again, I'm not sure what I got out of this therapy, but it was always great to talk to John. He felt like a friend to me, never judged me and always provided stimulating conversation. I'm not great at talking, but I could talk with John. Unfortunately private therapy is expensive and after a while I couldn't keep on paying for it. So I stopped going.

During COVID, I spent my last days as a 31 year old in a mental health ward, being treated with anti-psychotics for what I've now been told was my First Episode of Psychosis, and in the tradition of last year, I thought it would be prudent to run through my year and what it meant to me. If you're interested only in the psychotic stuff, I would scroll to the end of the post - even if it's arguable that by March I was already acting, in some ways, psychotically.

**December 2019**

This was an awesome month. I had a great time. M2 (mentioned briefly in my previous post) was talking to me, he offered me some kind of commitment, I went abroad to Israel and had an amazing time travelling through the history of such a rich, rich culture, and then spent the longest day of my life in a Romanian airport on the way home.

I spent some time tracking the British election (geek) and accurately predicted some changes which just a few months prior were almost unthinkable to all of the reputable pollsters. I was interested in changing my job to advance my career and started to look around for new opportunities.

I had finally sold my car, this huge financial burden, and replaced it with a car which I'd paid for outright with a little help from my family. I was well on my way to achieving the things that I needed to achieve in order to feel good about my life and move back into a place on my own.

**January 2020**

January was an exciting time. Britain had a new Conservative majority and I'm fascinated by change. I applied for around 30 jobs to work for one of the new Conservative MPs. I got one interview, and was unfortunately told that I didn't have the political experience. I already had a job, and I loved my colleagues, but for several reasons, for me it felt like time to move on.

M2 sort of backed away from his commitment, but there was potential for us seeing each other. He lives overseas, but if he wanted a serious commitment from me it would be his. He doesn't seem ready, willing or able to make a serious commitment to me. But, my heart tells me that he's the one for me, and my heart hasn't really told me anything since RH. It's been a lot of thinking with my... Lady parts. By January I had been in love with M2 for well over a year, and it was awesome for me to imagine that maybe I'd get to see him again soon. It was awesome that we were talking at all. I always want to text/voice message with him more than he does with me, but that's okay.

I did go on a couple of sort-of dates, with a guy who reminded me a little of M2 that I met on a dating app. I always felt guilty though, because I knew that my heart was somewhere else.

**February**

I don't remember much of February, except that after I'd applied for a job for an American company, as I'd always been interested in living there, and I'd been fortunate enough that they had fought to hire me after I was interviewed and initially turned their job offer down.

Prior to starting the new job I had 2 weeks off and was considering a trip to Egypt. I really wanted to visit St Catherine's Monastery, a place that I hadn't known existed until I visited Israel a few months earlier. I love a last minute trip, but on this occasion I decided not to go away. If I was going to go to the Sinai region, I wanted to make a good job of it and visit Jordan and other parts of Israel and Egypt, too - and I just didn't have enough money saved up.

M2 had sort of dropped off the planet some time before I got my new job. He had a new job too, and I guess he didn't get the response he expected when he first told me about it. I'd been more excited that maybe some day my job would help me to move to the US.

I trained the lady who replaced my job in my old place, and started at the new place on the 25th February. I was super excited. Maybe one step closer to getting into the US, I thought. The receptionist looked a little like M2, too. So I started to enjoy some daily eye candy. Lovely.

The virus had started to hit at this point, and was really picking up it's pace in the news.

**March / April**

Was this period of time one month? Was it seven years? I had been living with my Grandparents for the past year whilst I took some time to sort out my finances. I'd finally achieved that and had started to think about moving out.

My Grandparents are both in their 90s, and they, initially, weren't worried about the virus. My new job at the American company required me to be on site to carry out my duties, so there was no option for me to work from home. In addition to this, there were at least 150 other people on the site every day.

It wasn't long into the COVID panic that I realised that I needed to get out of my Grandparent's place for their sake, and I hurriedly found an apartment not too far from my new work place. The keys were handed over to me and then a few short days later, the man who had handed me the keys was placed on furlough.

It wasn't the best time for me to move house. I borrowed a bed from my Grandparents, and I had a shoe rack for a TV stand. It was the first time I'd spent so much time alone since I'd moved in with my Grandparents, just over a year prior. I had to deal with my diet now, as I'd been eating my Grandparent's food for a year. I had to deal with the cleaning, with everything... And on top of that, I had to deal with it all in the manner of COVID - where everything was distanced and everything was delivered.

If I'm honest, I didn't think that I noticed too much of an impact from COVID. I was still going to work every day so everything felt normal. I was still seeing friends as much as the virus permitted, and I was still driving around and living my life. The only thing that really concerned me was that seeing my Grandparents felt unwise when I was exposed to so many people every day, and that I couldn't travel.

Not being able to travel bothered me a lot because I didn't know if the absolute lack of potential for us to see each other was the barrier to communication between M2 and I, or whether he just wasn't all that interested in me. He's always been kind of hot and cold, and difficult for me to read from a distance, but it had never put me off. I'm kind of a cold person to be around, and the time that I did spend with him, I knew I wanted to spend more. Immediately, the second I'd laid eyes on him, I'd felt like everything I thought I knew before about how he was the one for me was true.

I always had and have been scared that time and distance, as it did with RH, will be the thing that means M2 meets someone else. It's strange for me to type it, but it hurts me to think about. He isn't mine, we aren't together, but the idea of losing the possibility of us seeing each other again someday in a romantic capacity hurts me, so somewhere in this period of time I decided to tell him that I'm in love with him.

At 31 years old, I've never in my life told a man that I loved him before he told me that he loved me first. I'd never known it, either. But Good Lord, did I know that I loved M2. I was being patient in a way that I didn't know I could, I had faith that maybe someday we could work things out for the both of us together, and I knew that the way that I felt about him would last. It had already lasted for 15 months, even when he didn't want to talk to me.

Something else that I'd never done at 31 years old, was tell a man that I loved him by text message. But I did it. And it was like opening the floodgates. I messaged him once that I was in love with him, and then I'd said it and it felt so good to tell him. He didn't answer me right away, but he doesn't usually anyway. So I started getting braver. I'll send him shorter messages so that he can see without opening them that I love him, I want him to know.

And then I got more and more ""creative"" and before I knew it, I was in a spiralling mess of messaging M2 that I was in love with him over and over again. And getting no response. I asked him to marry me. I meant it, too. If he'd have said yes, we'd be engaged right now. But he didn't. And he didn't acknowledge my messages at all. So then I had to try and talk myself down from it. Which I did by messaging M2 more.

Of course, it wasn't ideal that the first man I'd ever told ""I love you"" who didn't tell me first didn't respond, but I'd known at the time that I told him that maybe he wouldn't respond. It's the risk you take when you send somebody an ""I love you"" text message. Or 100 ""I love you"" text messages.

**May / June /** **July / August**

Well that was all very romantic and daft, wasn't it. Never mind. Now I have a good long time to get over it.

It took me some time, if I'm honest. I'm a little bit like an armadillo, hard on the outside but squishy in the middle. It meant so much to me to tell M2 that I was in love with him, and it hadn't really gone to plan. He never owed me anything, and I would imagine that most people would be caught off guard by an ""I love you"" message, let alone 100 ""I love you"" messages in the middle of a pandemic when he'd just started a new, and I imagine stressful, job.

I didn't know what to do, but over time, the less I thought about it, the better I felt.

Summer was a bit of a wash out, but when British restaurants re-opened, I went on a date with a handsome doctor that again I'd met on a dating app. We kind of clashed but there was a little chemistry there and he seemed bizarrely keen. I wasn't ready for anything serious though, and even if I had been I didn't think it would be with him, but we kept things friendly regardless.

Work was going really well. I was getting on great with my colleagues, and starting to feel comfortable. I had created from scratch a daily reporting suite with some level of automation, streamlining a process which had become very time consuming for a large number of people - and what's more, it worked! I don't have any qualifications or any real structure for these kinds of projects, but I'd managed, and it worked, and I was delighted. I was constantly looking for my next process improvement project, and working well with my colleagues.

Slowly but surely, I was getting over M2. I remember sitting with a friend and saying that I'd never message him first again. It'd taken me a very long time, and one hell of a journey to get to that point, but I'd meant it. If he had nothing to say to me, then I certainly had nothing more to say to him.

And then just a few short days after I'd said that to a friend, M2 text me.

**September**

In September I took my first time off work for the whole year. I took a week, and COVID had meant that I couldn't travel abroad, but I could drive around Britain and take in some of the wonderful history and culture that we have here. I visited castles, a forest and an abbey, and one day as I was driving to see the former site of the house where Fred and Rose West lived, I got a text message from M2. It flashed up on my screen with my Mum in the car and I panicked. I hadn't told her anything, really, about my interest in him except that I had gone to Eastern Europe to meet him. As it flashed up, I said ""that's that guy."" She didn't say much in response.

We texted back and forth a little for a couple of days and then he stopped replying to me again.

It shouldn't be such a big deal to me, he's just a guy. He hadn't mentioned anything about my proposal to get married, and he hadn't responded to whether or not he would marry me. I figured, okay, no response is at least not a ""no"". He'd told me a long time in the past that it was difficult for him to think straight because his mind moves in a million different directions at once. I'd put a lot of pressure on him by being so open about my feelings and motivations with him, so in some respects I was just glad that he was talking to me again.

But it put me back on the slippery messaging slope. Every time he messages me and then drops off the planet I have to go through this same process of grieving the loss of him. It's really hard on me, when - rightly or wrongly - he means a lot to me. But the fact of the matter is that he probably just finds me a little too intense. ""A little too intense"" is also probably a huge understatement.

I'm not going to mention M2 again for a while now, but it's safe for you to assume that as the months progress and time goes on, I am still messaging M2. Even though he isn't answering me. I felt like I couldn't let him go again, and for whatever reason, incessantly texting him, just about my day or anything seemed like the best way to achieve this not letting him go. It was the only thing I could do.

Also in September, I got a job offer out of the blue from a girl who'd been in the year below me at school. I didn't really know this girl at school, but I do remember seeing her in a local bar one time and me smiling at her, and her rolling her eyes at me in response. I try really, really hard to be nice to people and that had bothered me and got me thinking about why she'd do that, when I remembered that when I was around 15 years old I had, for no good reason, approached her at school and with a smile in my voice and in front of her friends told her that I thought she looked like a Disney cartoon character; a male Disney cartoon character.

And ever since I'd remembered that I'd wondered if she had thought of me as a bit of a bully (which I never in my life before had ever considered anyone would think of me as). When she approached me with the job offer I was surprised (obviously, I thought she disliked me) and also really impressed by her career and career trajectory. We spoke on the phone and she was hugely ambitious, and clearly visionary in her approach about what she wanted to achieve in the new job that she was taking at a growing British brand, and the team that she was building to work with her.

She had a guy she knew from another business she wanted to hire, and then in addition to that she wanted to hire me, and offered me a 33% pay rise from what I was earning in the job I'd started in February - during which I'd already had a 33% pay rise from the job I was doing before. It was at an established company and it was clear that a lot of work needed doing, but I loved that. I couldn't put my finger on what though, but something about this job offer was stressing me out.

I talked to my Grandparents about it, and they thought it sounded great. Of course it sounds great. They told me that what had happened at school was ancient history and that clearly the girl who was interested in hiring me thought it was ancient history. Eventually, I decided to take the job offer. I handed in my notice at work, and told the girl I knew that I would be delighted to start soon. But something still just didn't feel right. I couldn't do it. Something about it made me feel like I was being set up for failure; which made no real sense, because S (the girl who approached me) was being **so** supportive. She had talked with me in depth, and offered me every reassurance imaginable.

But for whatever reason, the feeling of being set up just couldn't be shaken off. So I retracted my acceptance of the job offer, and then panicked for days while I waited to find out whether my job would let me retract my notice. I didn't want to shake the ground that I felt had got me through a pandemic; and there was still the overriding fact that when I joined the company I joined, it was a huge draw for me that while I worked for them, maybe there was a chance that someday they would be able to hire me as an employee in the US, where I wanted to live and had wanted to live ever since I was 12 years old. Just my aiming-low-ass had always seen it as something realistically unachievable for me, with me not being academically gifted.

After a few days feeling like I was on very shaky ground, I was delighted when HR told me that my notice was retractable and that I would be fine to continue on with my job. I should expect that in the near future my manager would spend some time with me just to make sure that I was committed to my position and the company but that otherwise I was good to continue on as I had been before. Relief!

**October / November**

Now. October was a month. The things that I remember happening are that I had a flu vaccine, on Columbus Day. I was still sending M2 inordinate amounts of text messages that I was in love with him, and hearing nothing back.

At one point I left work very early in the morning. I had gone out to smoke (which I was doing excessively) and sat in my car, but after a reasonable 10 minute break instead of going back into the office and continuing with my day, I drove home, and left my handbag in the office.

When I went back to work I was asked something along the lines of ""wtf"" by HR, but I don't remember the details.

In hindsight, by October, I was very much in the depths of my first psychotic episode. I don't know what else happened in October, but I know that I was reading a hell of a lot about the US election. I was hitting all of my deadlines, but I couldn't sit still. I constantly wanted to be up and moving around.

If I'm talking about my year aged 31 then it ends in the middle of November, and it ends with me as an in-patient in a psychiatric assessment ward, after a mental health crisis team was called by my neighbour; who's flat I don't remember how I got into. I don't think I would have knocked on her door, so she must have seen me wandering around the building. Luckily, she has some qualifications in counselling and therapy, and knew who to call to have me assessed. She recognised at that time that she thought that I was having a nervous breakdown, and for that I am truly thankful.

I don't know when my psychotic episode started, and I also can't give you a timeline on when things happened, but what I can do, is give you a list of some of the things that I either did or thought prior to my hospitalisation on 10th of November:

* I believed that I was being watched in my apartment, and I stopped eating, drinking and going to the bathroom because every time I ate I believed I was covertly guiding the negotiations in Brexit, and I didn't want that responsibility. I just wanted to eat dinner.
* I believed that a COVID test card handed to me after I'd been swabbed had on it the nuclear codes.
* I believed that I'd accidentally given the nuclear codes to Google by taking a photo of the COVID test card on my Google phone.
* I called the police, from the middle of a car park in a shopping centre, to say that I believed if I turned my car back on then it would cause a nuclear explosion. The police attended to the car park, and when they advised me just to switch my car on, I thought ""alright then, well, if the world ends right now, this is on you"", and switched my car on and drove home.
* I asked the police to follow me home to check whether there was anything in my apartment that would indicate that I was being watched. They told me that if I was being surveilled, it was a far more sophisticated operation than anything they would be able to see with their untrained eyes.
* I called an ambulance because I believe I was having a stroke due to repeatedly being able to smell burning. The ambulance told me that smelling burning was not a sign of a stroke.
* I called out the fire service to my apartment block because of the smell of burning. One of my neighbours appeared in the stairwell to try and reassure the fire service that there wasn't a fire. As he was trying to reassure the fire service, I asked him ""Are you in charge of fire?"" and when he said ""No."", I expected the fire service to keep on looking into whether there was any signs of fire in the building.
* I called the police to report a terrorist plot (COVID) being orchestrated by my Dad.
* I called my Dad to say that I had noticed a plot with one of his trademarks on it.
* I believed that my eye had been replaced with a camera.
* I believed that my thoughts were being broadcast to the world, and that therefore I was the head of the British Broadcasting Corporation. I tried very hard to stop thinking of anything unsuitable for children prior to 22:00 GMT.
* I got a copy of a Cosmopolitan magazine, to whom I'd submitted the last post I made in the hopes of being able to contribute to their publication. They'd turned me down saying that it wasn't for them. The magazine that I was bought had on the front cover ""You're Hired!"" to which I thought, wow, nobody was interested and now not only do I work for the BBC - I work for Cosmopolitan, too. Who don't I work for?
* I wrapped up my phone and left it at the side of the a road, and then went and asked a stranger parked nearby whether they needed their van (I needed a getaway car, and I believed that my car was being tracked.) Fortunately, it was still there when I went back to get it.
* I bought 2 pregnancy tests because I believed that I was being raped in my sleep. I tried to go into Pizza Hut to use their bathroom because I was too scared to go back to my apartment, and Pizza Hut told me that I couldn't go in ""because of the smell.""
* I took the pregnancy tests at the hospital, where I used both a hospital pregnancy test and the 2 tests that I'd bought and wasn't satisfied until they all agreed that I wasn't pregnant.
* Sitting on my balcony one evening I noticed a Tesla parked over the road. The doors on the Tesla opened, and I thought I could see a dead body wrapped up on the back seat, so I went out to check. Thankfully, the dead body turned out to be a roll of bubble wrap. At this point I noticed that I was now in the back seat of a Tesla, and figured that this must be my getaway car. I climbed in to the front, tried to download the app to pair it with the car (if that's how it works) and FORTUNATELY my phone battery died. My phone is a Google phone and the car didn't have the right charger in it, so I went back in to my apartment to find my phone charger. When I went back to the Tesla it was gone. The psychiatric consultant kept telling me that I wouldn't have been able to steal the Tesla. In hindsight, I hope that's true. If I'd have been able to pair my phone with that car, whilst being sat in the drivers seat, there's a good chance that I would have been arrested later down the line, and further down the road, in possession of an $80,000+ car that wasn't mine.
* One of my family member's had told me that there had been an attack on somebody nearby to the lake I lived alongside. At a friend's place one evening, she sent me a photo of Andrew Lincoln on WhatsApp because she has a huge crush on him, and I believed, instantly, that Andrew Lincoln was hiding at the lake and waiting for me, as part of a survivalist reality TV series, so that he and I could go to America together. I went home from my friend's place, put an umbrella up in my bathroom so that I could stop myself from being watched showering, got dressed, took the umbrella and went and sat on a bench by the lake waiting for Andrew Lincoln to take me to America. I figured since I was already in love with M2, that I would never get into anything romantic with Andrew Lincoln, it was possible because we would be in close company on our trip to the US, but I would give him my friend's phone number since she has a huge crush on him. I sat on the umbrella, so that I didn't look like I had a weapon, but did - it was a survivalist reality series, afterall. I needed to be able to defend myself in case it wasn't Andrew Lincoln that arrived. After I'd been sat waiting for a good half an hour, I reached the conclusion that the producers of the series must think that I'm ""fucking daft"" and went home instead.
* I believed that there was a huge operation in the basement of my apartment block where people that I knew and loved were being dissected and turned into electronic/robotic versions of the people that they used to be. I kept trying to see my friends and family to make sure that they were still OK.
* I believed that I was being drugged in my sleep.
* I kept thinking that I saw M2. He doesn't live in the same country as me, and in addition to that, he had not been responding to my text messages or my admission of love or proposals of marriage. But I thought I saw him leave my apartment block, I thought I saw him driving alongside me on the way to the hospital, and I thought I saw him leave the hospital. When I thought I saw him leave the hospital I followed him outside, and when I saw my Mum outside, told her I thought I'd seen him. She told me ""M2 isn't here"", and I broke down in tears and had to be coaxed back into the hospital. One day I thought I walked into my apartment and found him in there, alone, in the dark in my bed. I was heartbroken when I realised I'd just left my duvet all scrunched up. At one point I messaged one of his friends on Instagram (a kind of thing I've never done in my whole life) because I wanted to check that he was okay, and he wasn't answering my messages. He understandably did not appreciate that. It is stalking kind of behaviour, and I really don't want to be that person - despite everything that I've written here.
* When the mental health crisis team came to assess me, I told them I thought I had seen Vladimir Putin in a local supermarket car park, I felt like I was in the Cold War, and that I thought I had a nuclear bomb inside me. I've been told that I actually told the crisis team that Vladimir Putin had been in my bedroom and that I had a nuclear bomb inside me, but I don't remember that at all. I've since heard jokes about Vlad the Impaler. I also thought my neighbour was drugging me with ketamine.

When I'm writing here that I believed things, I **believed** them. To me, they were true. And I had theories upon theories to back up why what was happening was happening. Every time I had a new idea I weaved it in amongst the other idea's I had; sometimes my Grandparents were the Queen and Prince Philip. Sometimes my Mum was Boris Johnson, and other times she was Princess Diana. Sometimes I was an MI5 agent, other times I was just a person that had stumbled across a tremendous, terrifyingly fascinating plot by those with the largest amounts of power in the world.

Hunter Biden was also a source of endless fascination for me.

But, in the tradition of last years post, I will write only about my year aged 31 on this post. My birthday was in the middle of November, and I spent it alone, in a psychiatric assessment unit. Also this is a very long post, and if anybody got this far... Well done and thanks for reading.

Wonder where my year age 32 will need to be posted?

Also - I am usually a very, very private person. I don't talk to people about what I consider ""sordid details"" of my life very often. I have 4 or 5 close friends with whom I'd share these things, and that would be that. I've tried to be very vague here about any identifying details, and I guess just because of residual paranoia would like to say that if you enjoyed reading this then please respect my privacy :) :) :)",Relaxed

Woke early with some clarity. Took notes for clarity, I thought it was very helpful to me and thought I'd share in case it is for anyone else. I hope there are more such mornings ahead.

Clear lucidity this morning after waking from a dream. Clarity of memories. The forms of childhood, the stacks of experience unfolding ongoing which unwittingly comprises who I am.
To begin born with a defective ear which caused such constant blinding pain it was an experiential course in managing that pain through difficult acceptance, understanding, avoiding and distraction, strength and endurance and sometimes escape through medication, surgery, physical surrender and bursting eardrums and periods of alleviation. During times of alleviation there was ""normal childhood"" which I presume would be the standard experience growing up outside of intense lightening pain for most others though we all have our particular unique life paths. Some times were good and fun and most importantly safe. Unfortunately in the 70s in my neighborhood there were a few young boys slightly older than me who found their fun in kicking me around, maticulously torchering my happiness away through physical pain and violence, mental and emotional manipulation, continual betrayal of trust and cruel actions such as destroying my favorite toys. I was imprinted by pain and became branded as a child you could beat on. It continued out of the neighborhood into preschool, kindergarten and gradeschool, as did the gradually lessening but still regular intermittent anxiety through painful ear episodes until finally through puberty they had grown into place. Meanwhile a little plastic tube placed in my ear as an infant had fallen in and not out a few days after it was surgically implanted without the aid of anesthetic and would remain there agitating further the underlying conditions until eventually finding it's way out in my late thirties. 
Toys were a respite from the pain and filled my little world with wonder and escape however fleeting. Adults were largely not present in a positive way though I know I was loved and cared for by my mother despite her own troubles at the time dealing with my father and their relationship and I was adored by his father and my mother's mother. My father was incomplete and though he knew he ought to he had trouble loving me unconditionally. I imprinted largely on my mother and was absent a steady fatherly hand. Our interactions mostly ended in his frustration and/or domination. It was great to do things that would not end up that way, like tossing a ball, but there was little time for the opportunity of patience and space to align. Otherwise he'd have fun with me joining with my sister and tickling me excruciatingly. I hated that, would laugh-scream and wet my pants which seemed to be the point. Perhaps they just liked making me laugh so hard and thought I liked it, I can give them that break - though I seem to recall some recognition of foul play be mentioned by mom.

Gradually as I grew through the pain and childhood subordination I discovered fighting back against the bullies who found delight in me as a target and I would enjoy the chase for my part but not the beatings or taunting - finally after returning a first kick it was all over and so I began fighting anyone who'd challenge me for the next couple of years, quickly running through my few friends and finding myself a stringy haired loner with a can-do fuck-you attitude. I'd also discovered stealing icey treats in my shin guards from the local convenience store a way to make friends on the soccer team. I was shown to steal by some of those older bullies, as well as one time (after third grade I believe) being coerced and cajoled into entering through the window of my summer school classroom where a (substitute) young female teacher was really laying into me in an awful way for some reason I did not understand and completely turning the place over in a fury of resentment fueled retaliation. That preceded the notion of thieving, had set some stage. I was never approached or caught for it though I'm sure she must have known it was me - I believe she even returned to the classroom with the class (they were on a field trip somewhere and I was not allowed to accompany them I have the impression) as I scurried out the window, looking back at a distance finally and seeing her bewildered head tilting out the unfolded lower window I'd climbed in and out of. I was trouble for athority, talking back to teachers in little and big ways. I hated scouts. I was fiercely bullied there by an overgrown beanstalk named Kilo who'd mercilessly squeeze the back of my neck to make me yield to the suffering which I would not. Other scouts would look on without saying a word as I recall. Motherfucker.
I'd been graced by an insightful teacher in 7th grade who helped give me an experience through leadership camp that would change my trajectory by offering me positive alternate social experiences, reliable adult role models and meaningful usable tools for self growth, understanding and progressing with personal drive and command. Thank you Jeff Stark.

So this morning as I recall this alignment of important impactful experience, the small details of smells and small spaces and faces and names long forgotten, awkward situations, uncomfortable, mooreless, absent of positive role models, etc I realized something like this...
There were conditions I was born into of horrible physical excruciation, terror set upon my innocence by others older and capable of it and pain streaming between the two and weaving amongst my family members and in any voids would be filled in with witness of space or the occupying of that time with freedom to choose, and what I would choose would be pleasure, antidote to pain, with imagination and enjoyment of whatever my senses could contact and I could control. These times seemed few and far between though also incredibly important.
I wanted instinctually to be loved and accepted. Anywhere. By my self, by my mom and dad, grandparents, sister, friends, other parents, teachers - anybody. I had trouble finding any feeling of security in this though, due to circumstances beyond our control or reckoning and filled the void however I could manage, successfully or not.

It is important to see this for my own personal understanding of my self and the form of my life, to chart my course and location, realizing the relatively, the recognition of what had occurred prior to the overwhelming destraction of obedience to law and the dollar and debt, paying with constant time and attention all the while being unpresent and gradually increasingly ignorant of what being truly present is. Who I am. Not an expectation or role or rectangle on an org chart. Just this experience I call me and an understanding of what's really included there (with the benefit of some perspective) which feels enormously helpful and full of meaning. I had to write it down lest the next wave of distraction pulls me way away again. It's perhaps an opportunity of the disconnection from the juggernaut of modern money making society that created the quiet space sufficient for this lucidity. In any case I prize the fortune and hope earnestly to allow greater such space to distinguish other myriad connections and flowers of feelings and unfolding understandings or clarifying the misunderstandings. Thank you.",Relaxed
2701,"Tunneling my way through a mountain using plastic fork...  Constantly feeling like everyone can see through me, like I've embarrassed myself in some way and many, many people think I'm a laughing stock and take great delight in treating me like a loser/freak/asshole, and worse, I worry that they feel justified...that's infuriating all on it's own, the fact they feel justified (or that I imagine them to).

Feeling like a raw nerve, emotions out of control, fucking annoying. Anything sets me off in to irritation, feeling violated or insulted, in to feeling so small and pathetic and controlled/disrespected/stepped on

Triggered to intense anger all throughout the day. Usually when some memory of abuse or bullying (from several different sources, some of it ongoing) comes up. Feeling castrated...unsafe, disgusted with the world and with how much abuse I've been the victim of undeservedly. Not saying I walk on water, not saying I don't have traits and behaviors that invite abuse, I do, but I'm not going out of my way to harm others and yet so many of them do so to me. Rage on another level. Fear and powerlessness on another level.

Paranoia. feeling like I'm being watched whenever I come and go from my house...no matter where i live this always happens.

OCD thoughts, repetitive, intrusive, always with a message of doom.

Narcissistic abuse in my life, fucking evil annoying unbearable sister. Wish I could cut her out of my life but I love my nephew too much.

Feeling trapped where I am, working harder than ever to get out of here (debt, mental health issues/shaky foundation mean it's not possible at the moment). Seeing other peoples live and the travel they do and knowing I DESPERATELY need a change of scenery and new life experiences but being stuck in this place for now.

Feeling bullied, being bullied. The thoughts of this treatment torturing me throughout the day, causing insane rage attacks. The slightest provocation now feels like abuse, has for some time.

Irritation at the simplistic things people say to me about my mental health, about strategies, anything about interpreting the ""what"" is wrong with me because this stuff is so numerous, so obtuse, and I'm using a broken brain to try to shine a light on it, and yet people talk to me as if I'm not only playing with a full deck, but that I've got a doctorate in this stuff and a full team of assistants to compile, analyze, and interpret this fucking mess in my head, as if it all ""makes sense"" or can even be talked about or journalled about in a meaningful, thorough way that will help make sense of it so ""it"" can be dealt with.

Hopelessness at the useless ""treatments"" that exist for mental health and addiction. Been there multiple times, done that multiple times. 

Insane repetitive obsessive thoughts about this stuff, about how trapped and hopeless I feel, about how annoying and useless most advice or guidance is, about how I feel so fucked that I can't even accept guidance or help anymore because the countless other attempts felt just like another broken attempt at connecting and learning, just more pain from interaction with fellow humans, more money wasted, more time wasted.

Perfectionism. Body never good enough. Perfect voice always wants more, more more, effort, but the impulsivity and addictions are a constant confounding factor. Even when I'm doing really well with fitness and nutrition it's still a MAJOR uphill battle...I never stop craving junk and laziness, the working out is never good enough.

Constant thoughts about how unsafe I feel, about how selfish and scary the ""herd' is, everytime I walk out my front door I'm greeted  with various forms of insanely infuriating selfishness, stupidity, hatred, ignorance, and I'm guilty of all of those things too which means I can't say anything. Terrified and obsessed with people losing their temper on me over misunderstandings or mistakes, worried I won't keep my cool and will react with anger instead of keeping a calm head, feeling so powerless to control my reactions, hating my self for it and fearing for my future. 

So easily hurt. Feeling like the manipulative ones see me a mile away and take pleasure in toying with me. Feeling too stupid and weak to do anything. Can't fucking stand up for myself in a healthy way consistently, my mind goes blank and i just revert to being a doormat and then get insanely angry and scared later, or I lose my temper in the moment. Both are fucked up and destructive. Can't...seem...to....be...strong...and....healthy...in...social...situations. No matter my best effort I give my power away, get stepped on, then seethe with impotent rage later on.

Feeling hopeless that nothing will ever work.

Working two jobs, doing my best to do my absolute best at both but still getting shit on at one of them regularly and having to deal with asshole customers at the other one...(to be fair many customers are really nice and it lights me up but many get inside my head on a daily basis and I take it home with me and think ""what is wrong with me?! What did i do to be treated like a weirdo or laughed at or smirked at or treated rudely???).

Alone. No friends. Bored of, or scared of, other people. Can't connect.Somehow I'm socially stunted and repulsive apparently. I usually become a doormat, a laughing stock. So many memories of being mocked and treated like absolute shit. I'm such a child and everyone can see it and sense they're better than me. It guts me. Fucking affirmations don't work. Don't bring up the law of attraction.

Want desperately to be out of debt, out of here, out of my head, out of this version of me, out of my shitty familial and ""friend"" and bad work relationships. Out of my jobs, in to work that is satisfying, around people who light me up and vice versa. Healed, not raging, not impotent, not obsessive, not addicted, not shame based, not self loathing, not constantly afraid.",Relaxed
2702,"Panic attacks and depressive moods/ gas lighting  I am not sure where to start. I opened up to a good friend about my panic attacks and that I actually have depressive moods and all, because they mentioned last week that they are studying about mental diseases now as part of their masters and I wanted to know. I had a panic attack this evening actually and thought ‚Ä¶ this can not be normal. I should give it a shot and describe it as best I can because normal depression or PTSD or what you usually find on google doesn‚Äôt fit. And she send me textbook screenshots that make it pretty clear what I have is panic attack disorder. And a bunch of side effects that probably come from living with it half a life (started when I was about 12, I am 24 now). The good thing is now that it has a label I feel confirmation that I should seek help and go to therapy. It‚Äôs a relief actually. There are only 3 people that have witnessed my panic attacks and thus found out. She is the first person I told willingly‚Ä¶ and also the first person that suggested I should get help but that‚Äôs okay and a good thing for me to do. However I still feel to ashamed to tell her the whole story of it all‚Ä¶ I mean I even hid my panic attacks from my own parents as best I could. I just wanna vent and maybe someone had similar experiences and has tips‚Ä¶

I think the root issue is that I am kind of sensitive and when I was growing up there was a lot of anger and arguments in the household. I have wished and prayed for my parents to get a divorce. Sometimes that‚Äôs the better choice. They are still together however and probably still fight every day. I remember getting worried and stressed, not understanding why they are getting so loud or pushing each other since 5 years old. Growing up I realized my mom has real anger management problems and sometimes she remembers things wrong. Like instead of what actually happened she makes up a story and starts believing in that instead. Anyways, where I am going is I often ended up being the one who had to take the left over anger. She got upset with me for the smallest mistakes. I was living under the impression if I even breath to loud my mom might explode with anger and start screaming at me for an hour or so and sometimes even hit me. Thank got hitting was not always a part of it. Because arguing happened EvERy single day. But there was: Sometimes pulling my hair, sometimes slapping me, sometimes beating my arms, sometimes sometimes choking. Fun fact: she did the hitting only when no one else was around and I confided only one or two times in my brother and my dad. You know when it stopped? That‚Äôs right never really. I moved out after she destroyed my room and things that were important to me when I was 19 and still only rarely talk to her. The hitting stopped however after I pushed her and spat in her face when I was 17. I clearly remember pacing up and down in the basement crying and thinking ‚Äúhow can I make her have more respect towards me? I am not a little child anymore now. She doesn‚Äôt understand I let her hit me only because I don‚Äôt want to fight back and hit my own mother?‚Äù But the thing was, I remembered that when my brother spat her in the face and slapped her during one of the worst fights they ever had‚Ä¶ she ended up apologizing to him. So I did what actually broke my heart and when she unreasonably started hitting me again I did what I prepared, pushed her away from me spat in her face and just said ‚ÄúI am taller than you now. Don‚Äôt ever dare touching me again.‚Äù And it worked. Hitting overall stopped. 

Where was my dad? In my family my dad is like a prop who was just there to have arguments with my mom. In my whole life I maybe had a handful of heart to heart conversations with him. As a teenager I went weeks without talking to him, it wasn‚Äôt necessary. I was under the impression he didn‚Äôt care. Maybe he had other reasons. I don‚Äôt now. 

What about the brother I mentioned? My brother is an absolute narcissist. He has anger management issue and the same weird perception of reality as my mom, just a tad less crazy. If you confront him with absolute proof he is wrong, he will accept it (unlike my mother). Also he is gambling addicted and somehow I had to listen to all his stories about it and play therapist from age 13 on.  At that time he was 18 and had, quit school and moved out. For my parents his choice was a very unexpected and traumatic experience because on the surface he was always the genius perfect boy. After him moving out is when my mom really turned her crazy up a notch. 
However growing up I had more or less no choice but to confide in this brother. I didn‚Äôt have any close friends until I was 16, it just happened that I didn‚Äôt share interests with my class mates. But on top my mother made sure to tell me ‚Äúyou should never talk bad about your family it will be bad for your own self / no one wants to know how you feel so don‚Äôt pull that sour face / no one likes and wants to associate with sick people‚Äù and this basically made it a taboo in my head to talk to anyone outside the family. So despite everything I believed it‚Äôs me and brother against the world. Even if he was never there. Even if I had to be HIS therapist and listen to him when he came to visit.  

But I was going to talk about me, right? What did that situation do to me growing up? Well‚Ä¶ the first time I remember feeling distant to my mother and thinking ‚Äúit can‚Äôt always be my fault. Something seems a bit wrong with my mom‚Äù was when I was 9. An actual memory of a panic attack I have from around 12 however. My panic attacks always manifest after confrontation. When someone is screaming at me and it feels like there is no escape. To this day, when people are around I try not to freak out in such situations by biting my tounge or pinching my hands. But when it‚Äôs just me or me and whomever triggers me I can‚Äôt hold it as well. I can feel when it‚Äôs about to get bad so I ask to leave or try to run away quite literally from the situation. Nowadays my brother is my boss and doesn‚Äôt give a fuck. With my mom however I was able to run to the bathroom or to my room and lock the door. It took years before my mother saw me having an actual panic attack. What happens is I get difficulty breathing. It‚Äôs like I am about to suffocate. My heart is beating faster, I get pangs in my chest. Most importantly it feels like my head is about to explode. Afterward I have a strong head ache for hours. My hands and arms start cramping. My panic attacks now are less severe then when I was a child however. It used to be so bad sometimes like feeling my eyes or gonna explode to and seeing white, also my ears ringing. It took a whole god damn while to calm down again. I might end up craying for hours with the panic attack repeating. Now I have developed some technics like slow counting or simply grabing my phone and distracting myself to shift my attention.  Usually I am out of the downward spiral after 10 to 20 minutes now.  But after really thinking about it today I remembered. What I used to do as well was , hide under the table. Hide under the bed. Hide in the fucking closet. Being in that small dark closed space made me feel like at least over this little tiny space I have control. And the darkness was calming. Remembering that now I feel like wtf how could I actually believe I can ever avoid therapy and how can I blame myself for some of the issues I have like I‚Äôm a normal person‚Ä¶ becaus this ain‚Äôt normal for sure. 

So when I was 19 I moved out and I avoid contact with my parents. However I ended up working for my brother. And it‚Äôs like he switched with mom ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs the one triggering me now. I am really sad about it. Generally I like the job. For several years now I have given it my everything. I was going to make a career in this company after helping build it. Not the whole time, but in the more work intense phases I worked as much as 70h a week. If a deadline was to be met I was working until 1am. Whatever was necessary, I can say I at least tried to do a good job. The pay is good and I was promised a lot of money if we sell the company. It has never been easy working with my brother and I have honestly had this fear that he will just use me and trick me and I won‚Äôt get anything I was promised for a long time now. But recent events made me understand now it‚Äôs not just a fear it might actually happen. I already feel tricked. To make it short: I was already working as department boss and for no legitimate reason he demoted me and cut my sallary but expect me to keep do the same? I feel like I am stuck and I can‚Äôt get out. He is making me responsible for everything that is not working out well, shouting at me in front of others. Than he says he is always nice, and he doesn‚Äôt understand why I don‚Äôt seem to be delighted and super enthusiastic the same afternoon‚Ä¶ I hate that I never know what my task will be , I can work in every department for the company and I now how to do a lot of things from production to office to telephone customer care business meetings marketing design or medical know how. And the result is also I am responsible for everything. But all I want is to do a good job, and I can‚Äôt do it if it‚Äôs not even clear what exactly my job is. Or if it‚Äôs 3 jobs at the same time. And in the end I get shouted at. In these moments I feel like I have no idea what‚Äôs going on and I am just not competent enough. Google says that I am being gaslighted. But the thing is, I don‚Äôt have the strength or enough confidence to even look for another job. When I am sad I feel like: Who else would let me work for them? Apparently I make so much wrong, also I am an unpunctual person (one of my most biggest problems). Also I know even if I get another job, what if the boss is also an asshole? The work will also be hard and I won‚Äôt even get as much money ‚Ä¶. And when I feel better I have like amnesia. I feel okay and I think ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the big deal? I just go to work like everyone else, it will be fine. I actually like the job, no? Lets just not argue with my brother and it will be good. I should just live my life and keep the job‚Äù. I honestly don‚Äôt understand myself. Because when I get a pannick attack again and it feels like dying I question how much of an idiot I am that I am still in the same place. 
 Recently it feels like I am getting more depressed outside of these ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù or ‚Äúgetting screamed at‚Äù. I feel more unhappy in general. I used to watch a lottttttttt of movies since I am a teenager. I was binge watching since before Netflix existed because it‚Äôs the best distraction. I am trying to do less of that now because I want to focus a bit more on me and do a real hobby like drawing. But it feels hard. When I am happy, I am not really happy anymore at all but I can‚Äôt understand the thoughts I had when I was super upset. And when I am upset I hate myself for being me. I tell myself to just go die. But I won‚Äôt, I‚Äôm not actually suicidal. I cut myself a few times as teenager and found out that I can‚Äôt cut deep or do any serious harm because it hurts too much. It‚Äôs pointless and stupid and might even leave a scar. So I will never do such things.

2703,"Unhelpful thoughts, unhelpful family members (long post. Sorry)  Just a bit of a rant/vent really with the hope that someone understands.
I'm not sure what I'm doing with my life anymore. I'm 28(female if that makes much difference) and in an unhelpful situation.
Last year my housing situation changed and I ended up having to move back in with my mum and my older sister. I've had to become a carer for my mum while my sister works, as well as having a part time job (also looking for either a job with more hours or second job), taking any overtime possible and trying to save up money to move out. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was in my teens and I'm currently on a journey to try and sort it all out. The past few months have been particularly difficult. I've been struggling to get a doctor to understand when I tell them how bad it's all getting. I did a cognitive behavioural therapy course last summer and was told that they would be writing to my doctor in the hope that I'd be able to get some medical help to get me through until I can get 1 to 1 therapy (I'm on a long waiting list). But the doctor I spoke to said that I'm high-functioning so they weren't going to give me medication. I didn't go to the doctors to outright request medication, it was just an option I was advised to explore. The doctor also said that all I needed was another CBT course. 
My mum has said to me that she doesn't feel I need any help with my mental health. She is on a lot of medication, as is my sister, and for my own safety I asked them both to restrict the access I have to their medication. They both ignored my request and on more than one occasion I have been tempted to grab their medication and go somewhere quite and isolated. I have the number for the samaritans on my phone and have even contacted them a few times.  But my mum and sister have both said that I'm doing it for attention. I'm really not.
I have a history of suicidal thoughts and self harming and they both refuse to acknowledge that. I've tried talking to them about how I'm feeling but neither pay attention. I understand it's a difficult thing to have a discussion about but they literally don't listen to me. 
My mum takes advantage of the fact that I'm home more than my sister and is always getting me to run  around and do stuff for her. She has arthritis in her back and knees, so I know shes restricted on what she can do, but she does ask me to do everything around the house. I do a large amount of the cleaning, cooking and shopping with no help from my sister. Theres one day a week that both me and my sister are home. I told both my mum and sister that I wanted that day as my day off, a day I get to myself to do what I want to do, a day that my sister helps my mum out instead, as she is adamant that she is my mums carer I thought she would actually help out a bit. But instead she spends all day sat in her room on her laptop. And my mum doesn't ask her to do any of the stuff she asks/expects me to do and just waits until the next day and gives me a list of stuff. The few times I've told her I've not wanted to do stuff, my mum plays the victim and turns me into the enemy.
I'm having awful thoughts again of how I don't want to be here anymore, I don't want the life I have and I don't want to live. 
I was advised that doing a bit more exercise would be helpful and I was able to get myself really motivated to start running again. I started eating better as well. But every time I get ready to go for a run, my mum tries to come up with ways to stop me going out. And even started trying to break down what's left of my self esteem. 
When I was a kid I used to religiously watch the UK version of Gladiators and found it on a streaming service recently. I started watching it again and rediscovered how much I admired the female Gladiators (they were cool). When I was a kid I always wanted to be like them and found myself realising that I still wanted to be that strong, fast and fit. That was something I stupidly mentioned that to my mum when I was working out a routine for fitting in some exercise (side note: no idea if I'm using the right word. Never sure whether it should be exercise or exercise. Sorry if I've been getting it wrong). She took great delight in telling me that I'll never reach that level of fitness. Or even get anywhere close. I overheard her telling my aunt that she doesn't even think I'm going to stick to it so she doesn't see the point in me even trying to be healthier. Every time I try and eat healthy or do any physical activity to improve my own health, they both seem to take offence. They take it as an unsubtle hint. They assume I'm trying to get them both to eat differently and be more active. I've told them, truthfully, several times that what they do is up to them and that I'm just trying to work on my own health. But I get digs like that a lot.
It just feels like every time I try and put in the work to get myself on the right path I'm being prevented in one way or another.
I appreciate that the doctor was just doing their job. That's not my main issue. That information was put in just to show that I have been to the doctors in regards to medication so have looked at the possibility.
But I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to sort myself out, get my mental and physical health sorted. But I feel like I'm in a position where I'm being hindered in my attempts. I'm not getting the time to myself that I need. I constantly feel like I'm on the edge of a breakdown but just don't have the time to do it.
I feel like no matter what I do I'm getting dragged down. 
I'm not in a position to move out at the moment and I don't know if I'd trust myself enough to live by myself. 
I can't move out, but being here is making everything so much worse. I can only see one way out of this. The urge to take that escape route is getting stronger. 
I don't know if I can keep doing this.
I'm sorry this is a post that has been all over the place and, most likely, poorly written. But I'm struggling to put into words what I want to say and pin down a thought long enough to vocalise it.",Relaxed

The world is better with you in it, and you have made it this far, you can keep going.

We are all affected by suicide, some people more closely than others.  Whether it was a family member, you personally struggled with suicidal thoughts, survived suicide attempts, had a friend or maybe had one of your favorite celebrities commit suicide, if you are reading this post you're still here & so am I.

My family has been deeply affected by suicide, and mental wellness, and I personally struggled with depression from a very young age. For those who knew me from a young age I had camp friends who just called me ""emo"" and had many classmates who saw me sleep in class, or even through a fire drill. No, not all pre-teens or teenagers who sleep in class or are very emotional have mental health issues but many go untreated and it can often be hard to spot. Around 80% of cases start in adolescence. There is still a heavy stigma for talking about this topic, even within me. 

One of my classmates reported me to the school counselor. Luckily the school was well funded and small enough that the school counselor followed up with my family and I was linked with counseling and antidepressant medications that helped make things bearable, but it was not easy. I almost failed out of high school and again an education psychologist helped me get through it along with all my supports, my family did their best to understand and be supportive but it is not easy at all. I had my issues in college, I even witnessed a friend attempt to commit suicide freshman year. But good friends, psychedelics and live music really helped me break out of my shell and learn to actually love my life. I stopped counseling and antidepressants and graduated, started working as a counselor myself and continued to love live music, found spirituality, yoga, a serious meditation practice, rituals, authentic relationships. 

Working with serious mental illness, a population that is likely to die 10‚Äì20 years earlier than the general population, you expect that some of your clients will die,. And one day they did, I returned to go to see a therapist myself soon after finding one of my clients a very kind and gentle musician in his bed dead from a suicide. 

For another year or two I was  going to counseling, live music shows, yoga,  meditating, doing things I loved and I was hit with another wave of major depression which catalyzed me go back on medication and to demote myself from a position at work to ease some stress from my life. I've had friends die from suicide, several died from overdoses just in the last two years. Let's not beet around the bush here, suicide surrounds us, there have been entire books dedicated to the topic,  this pandemic/political turmoil/racial uprising has really not helped in people's mental wellness and we still won't talk about it.  We have gone through collective traumas this year, at the same time as we are all grieving the perceived future we thought we would have without a pandemic.

Finding a friend to confide in, getting connected to a therapist, relying on spirituality or religion, using medications, all of these safety nets that we can use to help those who struggle with their mental wellness. i specifically use mental wellness because I want you to be introduced to [\#NeuroDiversity](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/neurodiversity?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZVhWKmLNgbj4-3qX3rpO4CjB7ANSTvV6r351tSzHatz56ZXMastsl1_znX43IRbBD8BaCL4OMlYUCYsST4JY59KXx2OLgXezdNd9qSQIXhq7hVkg0mf2grWwiB1Usdk9fo&__tn__=*NK-R). Yes I do believe that those major depressive episodes are illnesses just like cancer, diabetes or other unavoidable diseases but that does not make me Avishai, a major depressive. I am different than a lot of folks and diversity is pretty damn amazing when it's welcomed and accepted. Do I have some limitations? sure, who doesn't? But it does not define me, and it does not define you. That is why I write this story, because I know I didn't always feel this way, I know I wasn't always this comfortable to  be vulnerable. Some may think this is over sharing, I say, this post is not for you and I respectfully disagree, people don't like talking about uncomfortable topics and a lot of it is inherited stigma that stays around in our subconscious. 

This post is for all those who may have struggled with mental health issues in the past or currently,  
it's for all of those who are working in the mental health/substance use field to remember that your work matters because I truly don't know if I would be around to write this write now if it wasn't for my supports.   
This post is for all the individuals who may be holding it together right now and may be afraid or avoiding to ask for another safety net because of stigma.

It is not weakness to be in therapy,   
It is not weakness to be on medications,    
It is not weakness to breakdown sometimes and actually feel your feelings.  We are still collectively grieving a future, a present with a global pandemic right now and some of y'all haven't left the first stage of denial whether you are aware of it or not.

I'm currently in my final year getting my master's in mental health counseling, working with counselors to help those with serious mental illness and substance use disorders, I have the best grades I've ever had in my life and scholarships to boot, and I'm starting to find ways to innovate the mental health industry, reduce the stigma for mental health and substance use, advocate for harm reduction and have fun while doing it. I still get depressive episodes, several every year to be honest, and the traumatic experiences have only grown over the years but I am more resilient than ever before and I have dedicated my life to healing, found more passions than I can fill in a week, and really lived a life that I love and am grateful to be alive. 

If you need help finding a therapist you can start on websites like psychologytoday, talk to your primary care physician or call your insurance provider for a list of mental health resources or find your local mental health association, friends who are looking for therapists of color theramatch on instagram can be a useful resource. Unfortunately this process is not as good as it should be but that leaves room for improvement

If you want to support your friends who are struggling consider taking a mental health first aid training, reach out to that friend you haven't talked to in a while and go on a walk, have dinner together, call them on the phone, make an effort, it can mean the world to someone.

I'll leave you with a quote and a poem, thanks for reading.

Life doesn't get easier we just get stronger and more resilient. - Steve Marboli, 

""This being human is a guest house.  
Every morning a new arrival.

A joy, a depression, a meanness,  
some momentary awareness comes  
as an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!  
Even if they‚Äôre a crowd of sorrows,  
who violently sweep your house  
empty of its furniture,  
still, treat each guest honorably.  
He may be clearing you out  
for some new delight.

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,  
meet them at the door laughing,  
and invite them in.

Be grateful for whoever comes,  
because each has been sent  
as a guide from beyond.""

Jalaluddin Rumi

2705,"Helpful tips, advice, suggestions wanted.  *** Author's note***

This may be a long text post, so if you're not into reading a long, and thought out post, or just have a short attention span, please don't go any further.  However, if you truly have some helpful tips & suggestions, advice, etc with regards to the author's life issues including going to college, having medical & mental health problems alongside everyday routines, and still having achieved success in school while having moderate to severe impact from having those kinds of medical & mental health issues, then by all means, don't hesitate to share.  The author does ask that if you do read the post in its entirety, and plan on sharing your own answers & thoughts on the problems that the author is expressing, please be civil, polite, & thoughtful.  If you're planning on anything less than that in your response, it would be best if you just didn't respond at all.  Remember the old rule, ""If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say it at all"" still applies.

With that in mind, please read at your own risk!  Remember, though, one important thing.  Not everybody has the skills that some other people have in dealing with life.  I would assume, as the author of this text post, that the reason for this subreddit is to provide on a basic level some helpful support to those who either are having a mental health issue, or know someone who does.  As the author of this post, I admit that I'm the one who NEEDS support, especially on how to ask friends of mine for help & assistance, because no one is born knowing all there is to know about every topic imaginable.

Lastly, I welcome all polite & civilized suggestions.  None of that, ""Man the f*k up!"" bullshit.  Or, ""You haven't already tried [whatever it is that may seem easy to someone else, but is still being critical of my life & how I've dealt with it so far!]""  I hate when someone says something that I should've done like I should've already known how, even though my life & my family situations were not exactly a ""nurturing"" environment.  If you need any kind of reference about what my family life was like, think of ""The Simpsons"", ""Married... with Children"", and both ""Family Guy"" & ""American Dad!"", and roll them up into one big Jerry Springer show, and that would have been my dysfunctional, and highly abusive, family members & family structure.

Anyway, I'm ranting, and that is also one of my many shortcomings.  But please, do respond with helpful advice, tips, suggestions, etc.  Even if you think I should've already tried what you may have suggested for someone else, suggest it anyway.  I admit that I haven't tried a lot of things due to multiple disabilities in my life.

Hi all,

So, I wanted to get some helpful information about tips, tricks, suggestions, advice, etc when dealing with multiple health & mental health problems while going to college.

First, let me just give some background information about me.  I just celebrated my 39th birthday last week, and I have multiple disabilities including total blindness in one of my eyes, and I've had some 30+ surgeries on that blind eye in my lifetime.  Seriously, no joke.  I lost count after 15 when I was a senior in high school.  All of that stems from a birth defect caused by Congenital Rubella Syndrome.  I won't go into details how that happened, but if you'd like to know, please private message me, and I'll be delighted to explain.

Due to that birth defect, and having blindness in one of my eyes, I was harassed a lot in grade/elementary school, middle/junior high schools, and high school.  It was a daily thing, with the noted exception of the weekends both with & without the occasional holidays.  It became intolerable, but I also had issues with the home front having been abused in every way possible, including sexual harassment & assault.  Yes, men can have a past with sexual abuse & assault.  It's not a fun topic to talk about, and I dare not mention my abuser, because he or she is still alive, and I'd rather not have retaliation for it.  Needless to say, I had very few outlets.  Even less so with respect to my sometimes abusive parents who didn't want me to participate in certain situations, sports, etc.  And we moved around a lot, but neither of my parents were military members.

I ended up becoming highly introverted, seclusive/reclusive, plus having depression, bipolar disorder II, symptoms of PTSD (or so says my therapist when I mentioned what happens when my living parent brings up a certain other family member(s)), etc.  I don't have a lot of friends, and the friends I do have, I never call them to ask if we can just ""hang out"", and mostly because I place high value on being alone in my own apartment, and not letting anyone in unless I don't have a choice.  Plus, I have some personal things that I don't wish for friends of mine to know about, for fear that they wouldn't understand.  And I don't intend on mentioning what those private things are on this post, for another fear of someone I know coming across this Reddit post and putting together some pieces of information I've so far mentioned.

So, for me, it's really hard to break old habits.  I recently broke ties with a former best friend, because he was always trying to get me to do things to his own benefit, and not benefiting me anything.  So, I've blocked him out of my life.  I don't talk about him, nor do I have his phone number anymore.  That's how bad it's been with our ""best friend"" relationship.  It was a 20yr friendship that should have never existed at all.  He became almost as bad as the bullies I had to deal with in school.  

Other than that former best friend, I have other friends that have taken his place.  Friends who have given me their emotional support for times when I needed it, especially after having lived with my surviving parent for almost 10 yrs.  And that parent was also being manipulative, sometimes verbally abusive, etc.  I only tolerated them because they had a lot of problems with their medical & mental health issues.  They don't even want to continue counseling, because this person thinks that they know all of the answers already, and don't need help.

I have an older sibling who had also been highly manipulative, abusive, hurtful, & determined to see me fail so that they can claim victory watching me fall down hard.  The only family members/relatives I respected were my late cousin who was killed last year due to a then-17yr old kid making the poor choice to 1) drive without a valid license, 2) drive a car he was not authorized to drive at all, and 3) participated in an illegal street race that resulted in my dear cousin's untimely death.  She was killed instantly, I'm told, and didn't suffer much in the last moments of her life.

She was the closest I had to a sister in my life.  In fact, both her and her stepsister were both the only real female presence I had in my life growing up.  So, when the one was killed last year, I was devastated beyond belief.  I had also felt bad that her two daughters were going to be hit the hardest emotionally.  They won't have their mom around for the remainder of their lives, for the life milestones like when they get married, go to college, have babies of their own (they're both VERY ""baby crazy"", especially the oldest daughter, my sweetheart 2nd cousin), or when they graduate high school or college.

But, losing that ""sister from another mister"" was hard for me, and although my friends said I could always call within reasonable times throughout the day, I've not taken advantage of that because I don't wish to be an annoyance or irritant to them.  They've got their own life, and I don't think I should be calling & having a ""poor me"" phone call, you know?

Anyway, after all of this, I really want to attempt going back to college after a 2yr leave of absence.  I was going for an Associate of Applied Science degree for computer support technician, but then I had realized that due to all of my own disabilities, medical problems, mental health issues, etc, that there'd be no ""9 to 5"" type job, part or full time that I would be able to tolerate.  So, I changed my declared major to Associate of Arts Music degree with designation (AA Music DwD), and I'm now taking two online courses plus a private instruction course for piano on campus.

I really want to do well this semester, but already I'm having difficulty with being motivated to do my class assignments, i.e. the reading & making a research project for my English II Comp (ENG 122), my political science course POS 105, & practicing my private piano lessons, especially when I get a migraine attack that lasts upwards of 12 to 24 hours or more, and then I'm feeling heavily fatigued, depressed, etc.  When I feel good (relatively speaking), I find that I don't want to be productive, because then it consumes every minute of my free time in between painful migraine attacks.  And then when I do get another attack after being productive, it makes me feel like the stress of that productivity makes me less likely to want to be productive and work the next time I feel better.

So, what I'm hoping to get from this subreddit is how I can achieve success, or get helpful advice, suggestions, tips, etc on dealing with the demands of everyday life, being enrolled in college courses, and achieving my goals of being a musician.  My main goal is to be able to play both piano, and the drums, like my music hero Phil Collins.  I know, he may not be the best musician alive, but I like to think that he's achieved a strongly successful career as a performer.  Plus, I kind of play the drums like him by setting up the drums for a left handed drummer.  You may be asking what the difference is, right?  If you've ever watched PC play, you'll notice that the hi-hat cymbal is to his right.  While right handed drummers have the hi-hat to their left.  To be fair, and honest, I took private lessons for the drums in high school, and started out as a right handed drummer, having my hi-hat to my left.  I would still like to do that, and become an ambidextrous drummer, i.e. some songs I play left handed, and some I play the opposite for.

I want to be able to do my class assignments, and still have plenty of free time to be ""unproductive"", i.e. play my music or video games, watch TV and/or movies, tinker around with my computers, etc.  But like I said, when a migraine attack hits me hard, I don't feel like being at all productive, much less do my class assignments from my college courses, much less practice my piano lessons.

What could help me stay motivated, despite being severely depressed and/or fatigued from those painful days of migraine headaches from nerve damage?  I'm already on strong medications, and I'm supposed to be getting a referral to a neurologist, as well as an orthopedic podiatrist for my feet problems too.  Side note, I have flat feet & plantar fasciitis.  Oh, what fun!  I got all kinds of ""NOT FUN"" disabilities & chronic health problems & mental health disorders.

Sorry, I tend to put emotional emphasis on the seriousness of my personal health issues.  They are quite bothersome, and impact my life significantly.  I've even decided that it's better for me to remain single, so that my medical & mental health chronic pain & other problems do not become someone else's life.  I don't wish what I'm going through on anyone.  Well, maybe one asshat who occupies a political office, but I won't get into that here.  

What also doesn't help is that I've got family members who are less than supportive.  My older sibling has major narcissism.  My surviving parent is also a narcissist in some ways.  They're also highly depressing to talk to.  While I'd love to talk to friends more often, I hate using a phone to call them, and I hate making phone calls.  After working in call centers for some of my adult life, I'd rather avoid making phone calls, and just talk to friends or family in person.  I feel that nothing quite compares to having a ""face-to-face"" meeting with them.

That's also sometimes hard, especially when I don't feel well, and even more especially when I'm in GAWD-awful pain.

Anyways, I welcome any helpful advice on how to deal with all of this crap.  I want to be able to graduate college someday, but I still have a lot of problems, and I don't always have the resources to do what it is I want to do to fix any of it, but I would still like to have some semblance of what is ""normal"", or at least considered ""normal"".",Relaxed
2706,"What if anticipating mental hiccups could help us move forward?  De-stigmatizing mental health issues is an incredible, worthy goal, and this post is absolutely far from the first to address this. In practice, it can be helpful to remind ourselves that tending and taking care of our mental health can really feel no different than making sure we‚Äôve had enough water or figuring out a way to ensure we‚Äôre getting the appropriate amount of physical movement throughout the day.

Yet ‚Äî for many, and in spite of calls to normalize discussing our individual struggles with mental health, openness and acceptance of our trickier psychological characteristics seems elusive. Instagram tells us that we may benefit from sharing our struggles and our friends might talk openly about theirs, but there exists another option, exercised by many, many well-meaning folks: pretending we‚Äôre fine (really!).

If you‚Äôre not swayed by the cultural push for openness, or it feels like it would be incredibly difficult to reach out and let someone know you‚Äôre struggling because You Are Not Supposed to Struggle, this post is for you, and its thesis is this: Many psychological difficulties or struggles are nothing more ‚Äî or less ‚Äî than somewhat predictable, unintended, and uncomfortable outcomes of regular, everyday human psychological processes.

This is admittedly a mixed bag of news, though. On the one hand, it might feel helpful to realize that sorting out many of our mental struggles may be a matter of finding systems or processes whose outcomes aren‚Äôt working to our benefit any longer and gently guiding them back into places that feel more workable. On the other hand, normalizing mental struggles in light of their remarkably human origins suggests that Nobody Escapes Mental Struggles (or, at the very least, nobody escapes the underlying processes that contribute to them). Basically, if you‚Äôve got a brain, you can be sure that it‚Äôll give you a bit of trouble. This can feel a bit off-putting, at first, but it needn‚Äôt stay that way for long.

If you‚Äôre struggling, there is good reason to embrace the fact that nothing is terribly wrong with you as a Real Human Person. There isn‚Äôt anything to be cut away or exorcized, nothing dark and deep and terribly unhuman to remove or disown or hide away. If we think of our brain and our psychological processes in this light, we can draw a fair comparison to other body parts we treat with traditional medicine, as many other authors have done. Almost nobody cuts their arm off when their joints get a little achy, and nobody stops to pause before telling a friend that their joints ache, pretending instead that this weren‚Äôt the simple nature of joints from time to time. Mental health issues ‚Äî and many of the struggles we each face ‚Äî might not be that different, really.

Take an analogical look at this through cars, for example. What we call a ‚Äúcar‚Äù is a collection of parts and systems and characteristics that work together in specific, specialized, and somewhat unique ways to produce the anticipated and presumably desired outcome: effective performance. However, anyone who‚Äôs owned a car can attest to the fact that cars don‚Äôt *always* produce this outcome, and most of us readily accept ‚Äî tacitly, perhaps, in the way we do with more mundane yet annoying truths ‚Äî that the cars we rely on will develop small issues throughout the time we have them.

Yet, we don‚Äôt stop buying cars. We don‚Äôt send our cars to the junkyard when the window squeaks from time to time, and we certainly don‚Äôt hide them away from others on account of the odd noise emanating from the engine on startup. We simply accept, peacefully, that cars will give us some hiccups down the road. When they do, most of us don‚Äôt throw them away; we (or someone who has more experience with cars) dig around their parts, singling out the ones whose patterns or functions have shifted off course from where they‚Äôd most ideally be. Then, we act to bring those parts back to where they might need to be for us to get back to the serious business of ‚Äúkeeping up with traffic.‚Äù

Yeah, I know. It‚Äôs not that easy to fix a car. The purists will insist that *this* car is different from *that* car and so on and so forth, and they‚Äôre not wrong ‚Äî there are surely differences between cars, just as there are unique differences between people and the way they think, feel, and act. From a distant view, though, aren‚Äôt these differences fairly minor? This car‚Äôs tires might be different from that car‚Äôs tires in so many small ways and yet both cars run on tires, and tires share many of same potential strengths and weaknesses. All cars pretty much have windows, seats, and a motor of some kind, built from many parts specific to the car but sharing basic functions regardless of the brand or model. An Audi‚Äôs electronics system may be different from the electronics in a Honda, for sure ‚Äî but they both make use of electricity and involve wires and circuit boards and fuses and‚Ä¶you get the picture.

And yet we don‚Äôt often approach our individual psychology like we would our Toyota Tacoma. Maybe a great deal of the resistance we encounter in facing our own struggles head-on arrives as a result of this disconnect. Here it might make sense to ask ourselves: What would happen if we were to accept that human psychology is a little bit like a car in this way?

A wide swath of the humanities and psychological science backs the suggestion that most humans want, on some level, something from our lives ‚Äî and under ideal conditions we‚Äôre generally expending energy towards securing whatever that is. This is our ideal outcome ‚Äî effective performance (whatever that means for us, individually). In order to do this, we need our psychology to function in ways that support our efforts towards this end ‚Äî and, really what we‚Äôre asking is that *all of the little parts and systems in the brain work together to allow us to live our human lives in the particular ways we each want to live them.* We make the same request of the parts of our vehicles ‚Äî but unlike the latitude we afford our timing belts and volume knobs, we expect our brain to never fail, or wear down, or develop glitches, or give us trouble. This is to our detriment.

Not sold? I get it ‚Äî metaphors only get us so far, after all. Let‚Äôs dive into a very common, very understandable hiccup that our brains can throw our way: the experience of anxiety. When I work with clients who feel anxious, I often hear a wish to ‚Äúget rid of anxiety,‚Äù with bonus points if I can make sure this Never Shows Up Again. But, here‚Äôs the thing: I probably can‚Äôt do this ‚Äî and I‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôd want to.

Anxiety, as an emotionally functional process, exists to alert us to dangers in our environments and prepare us to act in response to that danger. If I wake up at night, and there is a cheetah roaming my kitchen, I **want** to feel anxious there. I want my muscles to prime themselves for quick movement, I want my heart rate to increase so that I can feed those muscles, and I want my breathing to speed up so that I can properly oxygenate my blood in preparation for me to find a way to protect myself, and my family, from becoming the midnight snack of this large cat‚Äôs dreams. Feeling this anxiety, and the corresponding attentional and physiological changes associated with it, *literally keeps me alive*. Without it, I might approach this large cat like I would my own, smaller cat ‚Äî ready to feel its soft fur, delight in its large paws, and kiss its nose. Without anxiety alerting me that This Large Cat is not likely to enjoy my companionship as much as The Smaller Cat, I‚Äôm suddenly the main player in an absolute catastrophe. Pun intended.

This is *not* to say that anxiety is comfortable, and it is *not* to say that this normative human process only functions in ways that benefit us. This system, for all sorts of different reasons, can wear down, or rev higher than we‚Äôre comfortable with. A great deal of anxiety present when our lives are not threatened can interrupt our ability to socialize, complete our work, get out of bed, and so on. An absolute lack of anxiety can likewise be a problem, given the well-documented phenomenon in which mental performance tends to increase alongside anxiety up to a certain point (check out the Yerkes-Dodson Law!). Basically, if the ways we experience the feeling of anxiety are giving us trouble in either direction, our capacity to perform effectively can be reduced.

Despite the ways in which anxiety can certainly give us trouble, let‚Äôs not throw it away, or feel awful for having it in the first place. It‚Äôs a part of us ‚Äî just like any other part of us, or any part of a car ‚Äî that can change in ways we‚Äôd prefer it not to, and derail our best laid plans. Just like our cars, we can learn to expect that the psychological systems that make us human will come with their understandable hiccups and that this is simply part of the nature of being human in the same way that hiccups over time are just part of the nature of the cars we drive*.* There‚Äôs little shame in taking your car to a mechanic, and we don‚Äôt anticipate that the mechanic will see the struggle and claim that this vehicle is somehow less a vehicle for having that specific problem. Therapists operate in much the same way, if you‚Äôre open to metaphorically bringing your car in when it gives you trouble.

So, yes ‚Äî let‚Äôs destigmatize the entire concept of psychological struggle. Let‚Äôs keep talking about it, and let‚Äôs keep encouraging others to do so as well. Let‚Äôs also, if it feels right to you, consider for a moment how absolutely and inherently human it is to experience psychological trickiness as we go about our lives, just as it‚Äôs absolutely and inherently normal for the parts of our cars to give us a bit of trouble from time to time.

These hiccups might just represent a part of us ‚Äî a normal, natural, human part of us ‚Äî that needs some attention, or some work, or some input, so that the part can once again contribute to the whole of our endeavors in ways more likely to help us perform effectively. We don‚Äôt get back to where we‚Äôd like to be by removing the parts or ignoring their rumblings completely ‚Äî and we‚Äôre not doing ourselves any favors by treating our struggles as some sort of alien invader (though they can certainly feel that way).

We get back to effective performance much more quickly by seeing our struggles for what they are: wear and tear inherent to the parts from which every single human being on earth is built, nearly impossible to avoid completely, and not at all indicative that the sum of the parts is completely broken and not worthy of further attention.

If you‚Äôre finding it hard to accept your struggles, that makes total sense ‚Äî nobody plans on things going awry, and living in fear of this eventuality just adds another layer of difficulty. When you *are* struggling, though, it may be helpful to remind yourself that this is Purely Human Stuff ‚Äî we‚Äôre all built similarly, and we all share the capacity for struggle.

It‚Äôs for this exact reason that therapists are here, for you, when you‚Äôre ready to figure it out together and get back on the road. As fellow humans, we‚Äôve been expecting you because ‚Äî after all ‚Äî this is all to be expected.

2707,"Trying to ""diagnose"" a fictional character [X-post from /r/AskLiteraryStudies] Depression? (trigger warning)  **Hey reddit!** (if you know a better place to post this, please tell me!)


There's a fictional character in a short story that clearly shows multiple symptoms for Depression/OCD/Autism spectrum disorder/..? I'm just curious and I'd like to learn more.

- What mental illness could be depicted? (I'm aware that it would be very difficult to diagnose someone like that in real life)

- I'm especially interested in the psychotic episode/halliscination/depression that is described. Has anyone experienced anything like that and is this what depression/a psychosis feels like?

There's no need to read all of it, maybe just the first bit!

**Symptoms**

- **Psychotic episodes, hallucinations?** 

‚ÄúWhen everything has been smooth and without painful incident for some time, when the tide has gone out too far, when Yvonne has been wandering along the street, looking with curiosity but no great interest at the lighting fixtures, the coral-encrusted bottles and the bridesmaid‚Äôs dresses, [‚Ä¶], when she‚Äôs gone into the Donut Centre and sat down at the counter and seen **the doughnuts under glass beneath her elbows, their tentacles drawn in, breathing lightly**, every grain of sugar distinct, she knows that up on the hills, in the large suburban yards, the snakes and moles are coming out of their burrows and the earth is trembling imperceptibly beneath the feet of the old men in cardigans and tweed caps raking their lawns. She gets up and goes out, no faster than usual and not forgetting to leave a tip. She‚Äôs considerate of waitresses because she never wants to be one again. 

She heads for home, trying not to hurry. Behind her, visible over her shoulder if she would only turn her head, and **approaching with horrifying but silent speed, is a towering wall of black water.** It catches the light of the sun, there are glints of movement, of life caught up in it and doomed, near its translucent crest.

Yvonne climbs the stairs to her apartement, almost running, the two cats bounding up behind her, and hits the bed just as the blackness breaks over her head with a force that tears the pillow out of her her hands and blinds and deafens her. Confusion sweeps over and around her, but underneath the surface terror she is not too frightened. She‚Äôs done this before, she has some trust in the water, she knows that all she has to do is draw her knees up and close everything, ears, eyes, mouth, hands. All she has to do is hold on. Some would advocate that she let go instead, ride with the current, but she‚Äôs tried it. Collision with other floating objects does her no good. The cats jump on her head, walk on her, purr in her ear; she can hear them in a distance, like flute music on a hillside, up on the shore.

Yvonne can think of no reason for these episodes. There‚Äôs no trigger for them, no early warning. They‚Äôre just something that happens to her, like a sneeze. She thinks of them as chemical.‚Äù,  252f

**Other symptoms**

- **Intrusive, extreme thoughts** (disturbing, though for the reader) (‚Äú[‚Ä¶] she‚Äôs about to eat their souls, not the whole soul of course, but even a small amount is not to be taken lightly‚Äù, 243; ‚ÄúShe finds collar-bones very expressive [‚Ä¶] the wish-bone, which gives luck only when broken. [‚Ä¶] This is the place where, in historical movies set in mediaeval times, the arrow goes in.‚Äù, 243; ‚ÄúShe will take this tulip back to her room and set it in a white bud vase in the sunlight and drink its blood until it dies‚Äù, 256 (she will paint it))

- **Obsessive compulsive behaviour?** (‚ÄúShe prefers small restaurants with tablecloths; the tablecloth gives her something to hold on to‚Äù, 247; ‚Äúholding on to the tablecloth with one hand, below the table where he can‚Äôt see it.‚Äù, 254; listens with her head turned: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs convinced that she can hear better with her left ear than with her right, a belief that has nothing to do with deafness‚Äù, 248; ‚ÄúShe wonders how many times in the future she will find herself doing up these particular buttons"", 259)

-	**Commitment issues, emotional detachment** (‚ÄúThey have never said she‚Äôs just like one of the family; they don‚Äôt make that mistake.‚Äù, 249; ‚ÄúYvonne‚Äôs place is always very tidy, but to Judy it looks precarious. It‚Äôs too portable, she feels, as if the whole establishment could be folded up in a minute and transported and unfolded almost anywhere else‚Äù, 250; ‚ÄúTo touch his hand, which is there in plain view, [‚Ä¶], would be to put herself at risk again, and she is already at risk. Once she delighted in being at risk; but once she did everything too much.‚Äù, 255; ‚ÄúYvonne avoids shaking hands with him. It occurs to her that he is the last man she will ever have the energy to love. It‚Äôs so much work.‚Äù, 256)


-	**Unable to deal with ‚Äúsituations‚Äù** (‚ÄúShe stopped [sleeping with this man] because of the impossibility of the situation. For Yvonne, situations become impossible quickly. She doesn‚Äôt like situations.‚Äù, 253)

- **Suicidal** (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs herself she‚Äôs in danger from‚Äù, 259): 

- **Last things** (‚ÄúShe wonders how many times in the future she will find herself doing up these particular buttons"", 259; ‚ÄúIt occurs to her that he is the last man she will ever have the energy to love.‚Äù, 256)

- **Planning suicide ‚Äì pills, razor blade** (‚ÄúAt one time she knew exactly how many pills to take, of which kinds, at which precisely timed intervals, to keep from either throwing up or passing out before the right dose had been reached. She knew what she would say ahead of time to fend off those who might otherwise come looking for her, where she would go, which doors she would lock, where and in what position she would lie down; even, and not least importantly, what she would wear. She wanted her body to look well and not be too troublesome to those who would eventually have to deal with it. Clothed corpses are so much less disturbing than naked ones.
But lately she‚Äôs been forgetting much of this arcane knowledge. She should throw the pills out: they‚Äôve become obsolete. She‚Äôs replaced them with something much simpler, more direct, faster, more failure-proof, and she‚Äôs been told, less painful. A bathtub full of warm water, her own bathtub in her bathroom she uses every day, and an ordinary razor blade, for which no prescriptions are necessary. The recommendation is that the lights be turned out, to avoid panic: if you can‚Äôt see the spreading red, you hardly know it‚Äôs there. A stinging in the wrists, like a minor insect. She pictures herself wearing a flannel night-gown, printed with small pink flowers, that buttons up to the neck. She has not yet bought this.‚Äù, 259f

- **Rational thoughts against suicide** (‚ÄúYvonne hardly thinks about this razor blade and what it‚Äôs really doing in her paintbox. She is not obsessed with death, her own or anybody else‚Äôs. She doesn‚Äôt approve of suicide; she finds it morally distasteful.‚Äù, 260)

- **otherwise a careful person** (‚ÄúShe keens a razor blade in her paintbox; it could be for slicing paper. In fact she does slice paper with it, and when it gets dull she replaces it. One side of the blade is taped, since she has no desire to cut her fingers by accident.‚Äù, 260; She takes care crossing the street, watches what she puts into her mouth, saves her money‚Äù, 260)

- **In need of control** (‚Äúthe razor blade is there all the time, underneath everything. Yvonne needs it there. What it means is that she can control her death; [‚Ä¶] Perhaps the razor blade is only a kind of memento mori, after all.‚Äù, 260

- **History of drug abuse** (‚ÄúShe‚Äôs no stranger to addiction, having once passed far too many chemical travelogues through her body, and she knows its dangers. As far as she‚Äôs concerned love is just another form of it.‚Äù, 254)
-	**Unstable relationships** (‚Äúher affairs with such men don‚Äôt last long.‚Äù, 254)
_______

**General personality traits**

-	**Correct, accurate** (‚ÄûThis has caused her to miss appointments, which bothers her because she‚Äôs punctual as a rule‚Äú, 241) 

-	**Overly rational** (‚ÄúThe sunrise is [‚Ä¶] only an effect of light [‚Ä¶]. The sun does not really rise at all, it‚Äôs the earth that turns. The sunrise is a fraud.‚Äù, 261; ‚ÄúShe discounts protestations of love, passion and undying friendship, praise of her beauty and talent, claims on her charity, whining and bluster; she‚Äôs heard these before. For Yvonne, only the simplest-minded rationale will do. ‚ÄòBecause I want to‚Äô is about all she‚Äôll accept.‚Äù, 244)

-	**Isolated, detached** (‚Äúher manner [‚Ä¶] is reserved and even secretive‚Äù, 246; ‚Äúthey never hear a peep out of her. She‚Äôs almost too quiet for Al, who would rather hear the footsteps when someone comes up behind him. He refers to Yvonne as ‚ÄòThe Shadow,‚Äô [‚Ä¶]‚Äù, 249)

-	**INDIFFERENT, emotionally detached** (‚Äúcuriosity but no great interest‚Äù, 252; ‚Äúdeep down underneath she would not give a piss‚Äù, 252)

-	**Nothing bothers her**, ‚Äúintends to be shocking‚Äù, 246 ‚Äì vulgar and obscene language (‚ÄúI was only painting hard-ons. Isn‚Äôt that what every man wants? The police were just jealous. [‚Ä¶] She has this conversation only with people she knows very well or else has just met.‚Äù, 245)

**Appearance**

-	**Clothes and mood depend on the light** (‚ÄúHer age depends on the light, and what she wears depends on how she feels, which depends on how old she looks that day, which depends on the light.‚Äù, 245)

-	**Variable and extreme, extroverted clothing style** (‚ÄúSometimes she rigs herself out in black leather pants and rides a very small motorcycle; on the other hand, sometimes she pins on a hat with a little veil, sticks a beauty mark on her cheek with an eyebrow pencil, and slings a second hand silver fox with three tails around her neck‚Äù, 245)

**Social interaction** 

**Signs of high social skills**

- **Is able to read people** ‚ÄúWhen the time is right, Yvonne [‚Ä¶] comes up beside the man, and touches him on the arm.‚Äù, 242)

- **Is aware of nuances in social interaction** (‚ÄúOnce Yvonne gets the men into her studio she is very delicate with them, very tactful‚Äù, 243)

- **High functioning** (‚ÄúShe gives the impression of being so serene, so perfectly balanced, that their minds are at rest about her. Whatever she‚Äôs doing is so obviously the right thing.‚Äù, 248)

-	**Pretending, acting, manipulating** (‚Äú‚ÄôMy Secret is that I get up every morning to watch the sunrise,‚Äô she says. This is her secret, though it‚Äôs not the only one; it‚Äôs only the one that‚Äôs on offer today. She watches him to see if he‚Äôs bought it, and he has. This is enough in character for him, it‚Äôs what he thinks she‚Äôs really like.‚Äù, 255)

**Signs of low social skills** 

- **Shows unnatural, learnt behaviour** (‚ÄúShe always says the same thing: ‚ÄúExcuse me. You‚Äôre going to find this strange, but I‚Äôd like to draw you. Please don‚Äôt mistake this for a sexual advance‚Äù, 242; ‚ÄúShe ran him to earth outside a submarine shop and said her piece.‚Äù, 257; ‚ÄúWhen they do ask, she has a repertoire of anecdotes about herself [‚Ä¶]. When she runs out of these, she tells jokes. She writes down the punch lines and keeps them on filing cards in her purse so she won‚Äôt forget them‚Äù, 248; ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs come to the end of what he‚Äôs been saying, which had to do with politics. Now it‚Äôs time for Yvonne to tell him a joke.‚Äù, 254)

_____


**Learnt coping mechanisms** (‚ÄúYvonne has had to learn how to take care of herself; she didn‚Äôt always know. She‚Äôs like a plant ‚Äì not a sickly one [‚Ä¶] ‚Äì but a rare one, which can flourish and even live only under certain conditions. A transplant. She would like to write down instructions for herself and hand them over to someone else to be carried out, but despite several attempts on her part this hasn‚Äôt proved to be possible‚Äù, 247)

-	**Social contact** (‚ÄúShe doles out these lunches to herself like pills, at intervals, when she thinks she needs them. People living alone, she believes, get squirrelly if they go too long without human contact.‚Äù, 247)

-	**Ritual ‚Äì watching the sunrise** (‚ÄúIn the summers, she takes to having afternoon naps, to make up for the sleep she loses to these dawn rituals. She hasn‚Äôt missed the sunrise for years; she depends on it. It‚Äôs almost as if she believes that if she isn‚Äôt there to see it there will be no sunrise at all. [‚Ä¶] Yvonne [‚Ä¶] holds on to the wooden railing to keep from lifting her arms as the sun floats up above the horizon, like a shimmering white blimp, an enormous kite whose string she almost holds in her hand. Light, chilly and thin but light, reaches her from it. She breathes it in.‚Äù, 261 (ending of the story))

**tl;dr: I'm trying to diagnose the fictional character Yvonne in Margaret Atwood's short story ""The Sunrise"", who has hallucinations, shows obsessive compulsive behaviour, has  psychotic episodes, is suicidal, depressed?**",Relaxed
2708,"Self Sabotage... How do I get away from years of self harm?   **Hi‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sharing my story because instead of continuing to harm myself and indirectly affecting others, I want to change and say goodbye to this growing darkness within. Perhaps it‚Äôs silly to think that I can part with it forever as it is a part of me‚Ä¶ But to be able to control it and not let it control me.**  
 

**As I want to remain anonymous I will refrain from specific names‚Ä¶**  
 

**I was born an only child in the USA‚Ä¶ I had the privilege to grow up abroad. I lived there til the end of middle school‚Ä¶ I had a great friend group and I felt quite content. My main passions being music and soccer‚Ä¶ My parents who had split thought I‚Äôd be better off continuing my education back in the US. So I get sent off to a boys only boarding school in the northeast.**  
 

**What would seem like an amazing opportunity, to get sent to a prestigious all boys, coat and tie, Ivy League road kinda school seemed like the start of a rough chapter for me‚Ä¶ Me, the wanna be musician, not wanting to cut my hair and conform to something I am not, aside from being bullied and getting depressed (and gaining a bunch of weight) didn‚Äôt sit well with me.**   
 

**My mother, feeling worried for me decided to take me on to continue my education elsewhere. We moved down south in the States and after moving through 2 different schools, I barely, but successfully got through high school.**   
 

**I always felt like an outcast, and loner kinda guy since I left Italy‚Ä¶ Like I‚Äôd been separated from all my friends. Slowly but surely, music, particularly punk, rock and heavy metal music would help me meet my first good friends since I left my childhood home.**  
 

**We would see concerts together, jam out, and eventually I would join a local band. All through Junior and Senior year, it became clear to me that music was my calling in life, and that I was (and AM) convinced that there was nothing I rather do in life that be able to tour and play music I love around the world.**   
 

**Since I didn‚Äôt really have my dream band together and I had absolutely ZERO business sense back then, as my parents and family couldn‚Äôt shut up asking what my plans are for College, blah blah blah, the most logical thing was to attend music school.**   
 

**I didn‚Äôt get into the dream school right off the bat, but after a short stint in the local community college and a second audition, I was IN.**   
 

**I moved back up north to attend this amazing, world class school. Completely oblivious to what I wanted to study, or major in, all I knew was that I wanted to find some kickass bandmates to form my band.**   
 

**Right from the get go, I isolated myself‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt really think much of it, but ever since I left Italy‚Ä¶ I developed more social anxiety‚Ä¶ I let fear cripple myself.**   
 

**I did really well in certain classes, but in the classes that tested the things most important to me, my creativity, my writing‚Ä¶ I would simply not show up in the most important moments. When it came time to hand in the semester final project, I‚Äôd still be in my room in a panic working on the assignment afraid that it wasn‚Äôt good enough, that I would be laughed at by my peers. I failed several classes as a result.**

**My frustration, anger and anxiety within myself caused me to start taking my anger out on myself. I would become physically violent within my own home‚Ä¶ I guess I didn‚Äôt want to involve other people, as I‚Äôm a pretty peaceful, loving person to others.** 

**I fell for a girl who seemed to share some of the same musical taste, and she was gorgeous with a lovely personality‚Ä¶ Me being socially awkward perhaps, I didn‚Äôt know how to approach her as every time I saw her she was with her friends‚Ä¶ I wrote her a letter once, which I guess she found kinda creepy‚Ä¶ I was trying to approach her when I‚Äôd run into her around campus‚Ä¶ But what was originally trying to run into her, became actively seeking her waiting for her to pass by the hall, or street. I was just a lonely, and kind of scared, but honestly harmless‚Ä¶ But I realize now with some of the crazies out there, that she just got scared, and rightfully so.**   
 

**After two years at the school, I decided I needed a break from school, that maybe it was not for me. I did not make a big deal out of the chick that I liked and it‚Äôs remained mainly private, but I got pretty depressed about that. I‚Äôve felt the need to apologize to her for the way I acted but have also been reluctant. Maybe I should do it.**

**My buddy who I was in bands with back in high school needed a bass player for his upcoming tour and invited me. It seemed like a great opportunity to be able to go out on the road playing music. I did it virtually for free‚Ä¶ For a month an a half. Looking back, through some ups and some downs, that month touring playing music was one of the happiest moments of my life.**   
 

**One memory that always stuck though was when my buddies were having a pow wow and asking each other how many women they‚Äôd slept with‚Ä¶ the circle turned around to me, and I had no answer‚Ä¶ Or in turn I guess they knew that that answer was ZERO.** 

**Post tour, I was having trouble finding a job‚Ä¶ I spent several months staying with family and a family friend.**   
 **I was playing a couple of shows locally‚Ä¶ Which seemed like they could turn into something cool, but the circle I ran with was more focused on the partying, and I kinda got sucked into that.**   
 

**I discovered cocaine and developed a bit of a habit‚Ä¶ But after going through $100 of it in a night, and literally sorting through paint chips on the floor to find any droppings of the coke, I decided maybe it‚Äôd be best to back off.**   
 

**I‚Äôd never had sex and I was 22 so I said fuck it and found a hooker. She must have close to 50 years old (and definitely did not match the picture on her listing haha) but she was actually quite a pleasant lady and of course I used a condom. I called another hooker another time, and got ripped off, and well kinda took a break from that bullshit for a while.**

**My father encouraged me to move to his city, where he ensured that there is a great job market‚Ä¶ I should find a job no problem. After scouting out a couple of different jobs I got the job selling guitars‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd end up playing them or fixing them more than selling them, but I was well liked among coworkers (or so I think) and got by for 2 years.**  
 

**Backtracking for a little bit‚Ä¶ All through my life, I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been in ‚Äúlove‚Äù, whatever that means, many times‚Ä¶ But the girl I like either has another partner, rejects me, or increasingly so in recent years, ghosts me.**   
 

**The first chick that I got a ‚Äúdate‚Äù with was trying to get more intimate with me and stuff (and I didn‚Äôt even know it), and then next time I saw her she confessed that she has a kid‚Ä¶ We pretty much stopped seeing each other since, and I believe she got back with the father. Good on her.**  
 

**As my dating frustrations increased, and my steady paycheck allowed me more spending money‚Ä¶ I started to fill this void by seeing hookers. It at least felt like I temporarily sedated my loneliness and sexual feelings. Still kind of ignorant (or careless is perhaps the better word) financially speaking, I was blowing through my whole budget because of my poor decisions.**   
 

**A guy who I worked with who was one of the top salesman for the company would act like my friend‚Ä¶ He invited me to write/record music and wanted to DO SOMETHING‚Ä¶ One day, I tried to get him to help me with a piece of equipment‚Ä¶ He didn‚Äôt seem to care to try to help me, and I called him out and said ‚Äúwhy do you have to be such a fucking asshole?‚Äù‚Ä¶ He told the boss. Boss told me not to curse/swear at him anymore. That dude is looking at me coming out of the office, and me, feeling that he could have confronted me directly and told me not to talk to him like that, I called him a ‚Äúpussy‚Äù and the manager decided to send me home for the day. I got called up a couple of days later and was told HR reviewed the incident and that I was being terminated.**   
 

**Life goes on. I would get some new jobs and start working closer in music venues and with musicians I love, admire and respect. While certainly not lucrative, it felt like I was heading in the right direction to hopefully soon find some killer musicians and make my mark locally.**   
 

**For whatever reason that has not happened‚Ä¶ I have struggled to make friends or be social here in this city. Lots of flakiness‚Ä¶ People saying they want to do something and then ghosting me, or leaving me hanging.** 

**I've wasted away so much time and even money with BS dating apps like Bumble and Tinder that I felt needed to to extreme's to find someone of interest. So I even went as far as signing up for a site called Seeking Arrangements hoping to find a lady friend‚Ä¶ I would help many of these girls with whatever means I could, but it would never be enough‚Ä¶ and ultimately it left me with even more wounds to heal. At least I was able to discover intimacy, and learn that apparently I‚Äôm a pretty good fuck. Haha.**  
 

**Meanwhile in the last 2 years I realized that if no-one else wants to help me, I‚Äôm going to do this MYSELF. I decided to write and record all the parts for this project that I‚Äôm hoping to turn into a powerhouse band. Between writing and recording the music‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve spent most of the last 6-12 months either delivering food, or driving musicians while they stop by town.** 

**Back in September‚Ä¶ There was an incident where one of the members of the artist entourage decided to threaten me with a gun while I was driving them. He started to load the magazine and then clocked the gun as to make me feel uneasy. This made me panic and I still am bothered about it from time to time.** 

**A couple of weeks back... I was feeling depressed just sitting alone at my home rotting away... I decided to go out on a limb and go street perform. After only 2 minutes of playing I was asked by two ""security guards"" to stop playing... That I can't play there when instead their coworker had told me there was a plug I could plug into, so I did just that.  I was being a bit of a punk and honestly sticking up for myself during some personal/internal challenges, so I refused to just stop. One of the guys put his hands on my neck and pushed me against the wall, while the other went and actually cut a hole in my speaker that I was using. They threatened to beat me up, and I ultimately got the cops to come to just settle the dispute. They let us all go, and thankfully the insurance I had originally bought with the speaker came into play.** 

**Lately I‚Äôve been obsessed with wrapping up this full length album, but it‚Äôs come at a price‚Ä¶ The amount of time and energy I‚Äôve spent on this has meant that I haven‚Äôt worked much, haven‚Äôt been social and generally feel a bit unhealthy.**   
 

**I recently got a seasonal job offer with a major company to be a salesman at one of their highest volume stores‚Ä¶ Something my friend referred me for about a year ago. I told my family about it, and they seemed delighted‚Ä¶ Almost relieved, as if I‚Äôm FINALLY GOING TO GET A** **REAL JOB.**  
 

**I showed up to do the paperwork, and thought a copy of my documents would suffice, but they ‚ÄúNEEDED‚Äù the original. After having moved a lot in the last year, I‚Äôve kind of lost track of certain personal belongings‚Ä¶ In the worst timing, I completely forgot where I‚Äôd placed my passport and social security card.**  
 

**This made me think about the job more‚Ä¶ Do I really want to be swarmed by customers during peak retail season??? NO, I do NOT. So I kept procrastinating about finding my documents‚Ä¶ Also being so focused on my music, I felt it would greatly interrupt my workflow to go sort through boxes/cabinets for hours on end.**   
 

**Anyways‚Ä¶ The company gave me a week to get back to them with documents and I kinda just let it pass. Tomorrow I‚Äôm supposed to go to Mexico for a cousin‚Äôs wedding, but after looking hard yesterday and this morning, I simply cannot find my passport. I could try to get an expedited replacement but I don‚Äôt have the money. I told my Mom that I unfortunately cannot make it (on her birthday) and she is pissed‚Ä¶ tells me I owe her $1200.**   
 

**I haven‚Äôt even told my parents that I passed on the job opportunity, but I have a feeling that they‚Äôre gonna rip me apart for it. I think about what they think way too much.**   
 

**Since high school, my parents had me see a therapist. I still see the therapist weekly. He gives me a great deal, and he seems to be the person I probably talk to the most every week. He also saw/sees my Dad. I tell him I‚Äôm getting better, but I feel I‚Äôm lying to him and to myself.**   
 

**I used to tell people that I could never lie‚Ä¶ I was always proud of being honest, and not cheating other people, but thinking about the last couple of years, I‚Äôve been breaking all those rules. I keep getting what at first are just second chances‚Ä¶ turning into third, fourth, fifth chances‚Ä¶ And ultimately I‚ÄôM ALWAYS THERE TO FUCK THINGS UP.**   
 

**The irony is the people that I work for compliment me for having the best manners, and attitude. I‚Äôve been described as charismatic, and having a charming and very polite personality. I tend to be that way with others, except I seem to be hell bent on destroying myself, LITTLE BY LITTLE.**   
 

**I‚Äôve thought about taking my life many times, but I don‚Äôt have the guts to do it. I‚Äôve even opened up about it at times, and I‚Äôm thankful that there‚Äôs always love and support on the other side. I recently was having a tough time and a friend of a friend (who‚Äôs 55 years old) decided to take me out for lunch. It was a truly beautiful day for me. On that same day I got invited to have coffee with another family friend‚Ä¶ A high school buddy was visiting town, and I got invited by a cute girl to a halloween party.**   
 

**I kinda like her‚Ä¶ I gave her and her friends a ride to the club they wanted to go to, and once we‚Äôre there she tells me she isn‚Äôt feeling that great and she kinda wants to go back home. She told me I should go and party with everyone, but I insisted that I hate parties and that I rather spend the time with her. She told me she could uber but I thought that was unnecessary, so I offered to drop her off at home and I did just that. I still felt kinda lonely going back home at the end of the night but at least I felt like I was cared for that day. I felt like some people had my back.**   
 

**The difficult thing for me is that on a day like today, where I completely fuck my mother over because I can‚Äôt get my shit together and can‚Äôt find my fricken passport, I just wish I could fall off the face of the earth. I‚Äôve had suicidal thoughts today again, but the thing that makes me think it over is that I don‚Äôt want to leave the people that know me the pain, and suffering of knowing I took my life.**   
 

**I‚Äôm also tired of people giving me opportunities and second chances, yet I know I can‚Äôt pay them back, or give back to them‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm day by day more conscious and embarrassed of showing up at a birthday or a holiday gathering and not bringing a gift because I‚Äôm broke, scrapping up pennies, or selling my equipment to feed myself at times.**   
 

**There‚Äôs a girl I fancy that works at the supermarket right down the corner, but I‚Äôm with such low self esteem right now that I‚Äôve lost the drive to go and ask her out. The other day my Dad asked me how I‚Äôm doing‚Ä¶ I told him I‚Äôm stressed out because of trying to wrap up my music project. But what I didn‚Äôt tell him is that I think there‚Äôs a lot more I‚Äôm stressed out and struggling with besides the music.** 

**I‚Äôve been struggling for a long time, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt like to hurt other people so I hurt myself instead‚Ä¶ And in turn, the other people close to me ultimately pay the price, bailing me out and trying to keep their faith in me.**   
 

**It‚Äôs come to the point where I felt like being public about my struggles and maybe getting some insight into how I should shift into a positive direction and stay there.**

2709,"2: Dobby and Panic Attacks.  Hello! Dobby again. I'm ready with my sock tightly fisted in my hand ready to tackle the dreaded panic attacks. 

If you have ever had one, you know how bad and unpredictable they can be. I remember my first one... I was with my family aged around 14/15 in the Shepherds Bush Westfields. It wasn't too intense but I felt like I was in a bubble, separated from the rest of the public and unable to breathe. A very weird sensation and makes you feel like you aren't real. I now know this to be called disassociation or derealisation (phew, long words that are hard to spell). I had this quite regularly afterwards, along with sometimes seeing faces and monsters when I shut my eyes and very occasionally I would have delusions. My most intense would make me feel like I was dying. I would feel this sense on impending doom and time would go elastic with thoughts rushing through my mind. I would feel pain in my chest and go numb all over with a dry mouth and feeling completely detached and in real. 

Anyway. Enough about me. I'm pretty sure if you have had one, you can identify with that... and if you haven't... you don't want one. Trust me. :) 

Dobby knows panic attacks is a tough one. Different things work for different people. I'll list down some suggestions that helped me. Bear with me, I know some you have heard all the time and are very hard to do. 

1) BREATHE! - Yup. You guessed it. I'm not straying from the obvious or clich√©, but stay with me on this one. Almost every panic attack makes you feel like you can't breathe. But you can. There is nothing physically stopping you. Panic attacks are all in the mind folks and it is a natural reaction. (Apologies for clich√© again.) So what is a very powerful weapon that we have that we can use to trick us in to stop panicking? Yup, the mind again! Put all of your energy and focus you have left in to breathing. Try and do 7 seconds in and 11 seconds out, If you can't do that just make sure you are breathing out for longer than you are breathing in. DO NOT do short sharp breaths. It has something to do with science and carbon dioxide being acidic which causes acidosis which causes hyperventilation which causes panicking *breathes* (see? everyone forgets to breathe). The more you hyperventilate, the more carbon dioxide enters your lungs and the more epinephrine (adrenaline) and cortisol your body creates, causing the panic attack to last longer. I'm not saying it is as easy as 1 2 3, but it will help you a great deal if you focus on your breathing as much as you can. 

2) YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DIE. - Still not straying away from the clich√© I'm afraid, but there is a reason. Drawing on what I've mentioned before, panic attacks have looong been in our natural reactions to stressful stimuli. It is a natural, evolutionary reaction that was helpful to the cave men and women for the 'fight or flight' reaction. It still helps us to this day (ever heard of people being able to lift up cars after an car accident?) but not all the time. It's a blessing and curse. Although it can feel like a lifetime, panic attacks also usually only last 10 minutes and rarely go beyond 20/30 minutes. They are caused by a surge in the delightful hormones cortisol and epinephrine (adrenaline) but HAVE NO ADVERSE SIDE AFFECTS ON YOUR HEALTH. Remember this people. Panic attacks come and go. 

3) BE KIND TO YOURSELF. - You may think panic attacks are embarrassing, but a lot of people identify with how you are feeling. Don't beat yourself up for having one. In the UK, two thirds of people have experienced MH issues and a quarter have experienced panic attacks. A QUARTER. Imagine you are someone you care about and what you would do to help them or imagine that person is there and what they would say. Do whatever it takes to calm you down. Could be hanging upside down whilst singing ghost busters... it really doesn't matter. Don't give any notice to anyone else, you are what is important. To help others around you and stop them worrying, you have to put yourself first. 

4) F&*@ WHAT PEOPLE THINK. - Again, drawing on before. A lot of people's anxiety is caused by worrying what others think of them so this is a difficult one. People may be dismissive of you, not care or ask insensitive questions... but the majority of people will be concerned and want to help. Those are the people who matter. People aren't worth the mind space if they are d*cks. Most of the time, the d*cks haven't experienced panic attacks and don't want to try to understand. It isn't whether they understand or not, the important thing is whether they try to. Like I said previously, you are number one. Before you can do anything else, you need to calm down and to do that you make yourself priority. Every human is equal, but we are individual. Instead of anxiety, those d*cks might have anger issues or an obsession with cuddly bears that they need help with. We need to with an equal level of respect and care. INCLUDING OURSELVES. 

5) TAKE NOTE OF THE TRIGGERS. - This is an important one. Try to remember what is the main trigger of the panic attack so you can avoid the trigger next time or deal with it differently. You may think it could be a multitude of things or just thoughts but the likelihood is that there was a particular thought or occurrence that started it. This is another difficult one because panic attacks are unpredictable and sometimes come out of the blue or are delayed. If you really can't think of one, don't worry yourself in to another panic attack. It could be a random one. Just try to make yourself aware so you can help your recovery. 

6) DO SOMETHING MUTLEY. - (I hope you get that reference...) When you have regulated your breathing, find something to do that you can focus on to stop going in to another panic session. This can be anything from drinking cold water and feeling it go down your throat to colouring to fighting the dark lord (I, as Dobby, sincerely encourage this one). This helps to block out any thoughts and feelings that might be left over from the panic attack. I also keep a hair band/bracelet on my wrist that I ping when I experience derealisation or dissociation. This helps me to know that I am real and there. It can also help you focus on something else. Don't do it too hard though!! 
When you are not panicking, it's great to find a hobby as well. Any sports or crafts are great and even better in a team or making something for someone. I know it can be difficult to find an interest when you are anxious/depressed but it could even be colouring or doodling. I used to do that when I nearly couldn't move due to my depression. I also used to make cross stitches for my family as presents. That's quite a good hobby because although it may be seen as out of fashion, it takes quite a bit of concentration whilst also being easy enough to watch tv or listen to music at the same time. 
Volunteering is great too. Doesn't have to be massive or for a long period of time, could just be helping out at one event or campaign. It's really helpful as it puts your mind to something your passionate about, makes you meet new people and combats that sticky thought that you are useless and a waste of air. 

7) YOU NEED TO GET SOME HELP. - That isn't meant in a mean way. My turning point in my anxiety was when I started going to an anxiety support group. It opened my eyes to the different people of all ages and backgrounds who suffered with it and helped to make me not feel as alone. They gave tips and support on panic attacks and everyone felt comfortable (but not pressured) to share their experiences and suggestions with the rest of the group. We had a pact not to share the experiences or names outside of the group and if we saw someone in town to just wave and not stop and chat. The healing was kept in the room to separate it from our personal lives. There was one man who used to run a very successful restaurant and knew a lot of celebrities but had to quit due to his anxieties, a security guard, a couple of nurses, a man recently diagnosed with Parkinson's, a student, an unemployed man and a social worker. They really were from different backgrounds! But we were all open and accepted as ourselves. We were all on an equal level and it helped me a lot. 
CBT/Psychotherapy is good too. CBT looks at different situations in life/thoughts and how to act/think in a more useful and positive way. Psychotherapy is more varied and the psychotherapist will make a judgement on what method will suit you best.
Hypnotherapy has also helped quite a few people I know and most have even been cured. I know there is a lot of controversy around this and I haven't experienced it myself so I can't say much on it.  

8) OOOOMMMMMM. - Mindfulness! Again, the mind is your most powerful weapon. So use it! It is one of the main methods I used to help me get my sock (what I mean by that is become less anxious and depressed) and helped me immensely. It draws on meditation but not in a religious way and basically brings your focus to the here and now. It helps you to stop, take a breath and is also great helping you to feel comfortable in your own skin and accepting you for you. You don't have to do it for long periods every day and can fit it when you have some time to spare. You can even do it on the bus, walking, on the loo, before bed or anytime you don't need to be concentrating on something else. There are books you can get quite cheaply and websites/apps (here's looking at you Headspace) that help talk you through it. 

9) SNIFFS. - One of the most powerful connectors to emotions is smell. Ever smelt something and a memory or person just popped in to your head straight away? When you are anxious, smell something that reminds you of something happy and soothing. I used to carry a hanky round with me that had my nans perfume on it, but it can be anything. 
Music is another great connection to emotion... preferably without words in it as certain words can evoke different emotions. My friend used to listen to whale sounds and that really helped her. The frequency/pitch (or something like that) is especially calming. Music also helps to block out thoughts as it's quite hard to think whilst hearing something. 

10) SEE THE WORLD. - Another GREAT way of helping yourself is to travel. There is something about opening your connections, experiencing new things, new people and new scenery that turns a switch on. It helps to show you the world is bigger with bigger problems than your door step. It really put it in to perspective for me. It doesn't have to be for a long time, far away or expensive. Could be anything, even camping somewhere in your own country.
Star gazing is another hobby of mine that really helped. It makes you feel so small and it triggers curiosity which is great for the mind. I use Star Map which helps you locate them as you point your phone to the star you are looking at and it says what it is. The peak of the meteor shower is this Saturday as well!

11) DON'T LET THE TOXIC MAKE YOU SLIP UNDER. - Much easier than it sounds, but try to identify toxic people in your life and CUT THEM OFF. Can they be manipulative? Do they only contact you when they need something but don't repay the favour? Do they talk about you behind your back? Do other people warn you about them or does something just seem off? You really do not need negative people in your life, especially when you are going through a hard time. They can be draining and you need the energy for yourself. If they are a friend and they notice you drifting away from them, you don't even have to mention you think they are toxic. You could just say something along the lines of 'I'm sorry, but right now I'm having a difficult time and I need to focus on myself.' or 'I'm sorry this hurts you, but I feel like we aren't always on the same wavelength and our values and opinion's simply just don't mesh.' or you could just come right out and say 'Some times I feel as though you are insensitive and you hurt and use me without apologising.' with the key word being FEEL. If you don't emphasise this word, the person (especially if they are toxic) can feel as though they are under attack and the response will be more defensive than what you were hoping for. 
I plan to write a separate post on this as it is a big subject so please bear with me, especially if they are at work or someone you cannot avoid.

12) MAKE YOUR ROOM HIPPIE HEAVEN. - Well. If your style isn't hippy, that is fine. What I mean is; make it your happy place. Cover it in posters you like, pictures, feel good quotes and your achievements you are proud of. This means every time you wake up and go to sleep, you will be constantly reminded of happy memories which makes you happy. 

13) DON'T PANIC ABOUT PANICKING. - This can create a cycle in itself because then you can have panic attacks about worrying about having panic attacks. Silly I know, but believe me it does happen! It is very hard not to do this but what helped me with this is mantras. Something short and simple like 'I will not panic' or 'I am stronger than my anxiety' can be really useful. Putting these up in your room and on your phone can remind you through out the day to say it to yourself. At first, it can be weird to say it but after a while you really start to believe it. 

14) QUOTES. - I am big on quotes. I will scroll through the internet for hours to find loads of really good ones on any subject. A few of my favourite quotes come from the great Dalai Lama himself 'If a problem can be solved, it will be. If it cannot be solved, there is no use worrying about it.'. There is also ‚ÄúWorry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow, it only saps today of its joy.‚Äù  Leo F. Buscaglia and ‚ÄúWorry often gives a small thing a big shadow.‚Äù Swedish Proverb. Worrying does not do anything to help the situation. We all do it, but we can only act on things rationally and objectively when we are calm. 

Sorry this has been sooo long. I hope it helps a bit. Comment to say any improvements to be made or if it helped/ didn't help!

Dobby x",Relaxed
2710,"Dear Reddit, I'm finally ready to tell my story.  # TRIGGER   WARNINGS: This contains mental issues stemming from a life of abuse.   The following talks about physical and sexual abuse, drug use, animal   abuse (I don't go into details and it was never by my hands), and   suicide. Please don't read if you are sensitive to any of the above.

# -My Current Life-

I've   never before talked about this in this kind of depth and buried a  great  deal of what happened for many, many years. There's likely more  that I  cannot remember / have pushed into the recesses of my brain. I  often  blame myself, or my lack of perception, or <insert excuse to  somehow  make this all my fault>. I'm aware that's very common and  that it  isn't my fault, yet those thoughts still persist despite this  knowledge.

I've  also been through  consoling, therapy, drugs, alcohol, etc etc all of my  life (I quit the  illegal drugs and alcohol in my early 30's. I'm now  39.). None of it  has really helped and my life has been reduced to that  of a hermit. I  have severe agoraphobia with panic attack disorder (as  well as PTSD,  ADHD, insomnia and I highly suspect a little bit of autism  somewhere in  there), so I only leave my house when absolutely  necessary.

I  had started teaching  myself programming several years ago but the  anxiety has gotten so bad  the last year or so that I simply cannot  concentrate for any length of  time. I've been on disability for the  last 5 years due to the severe  stress/panic/anxiety/shaking/etc. that I  get whenever I had to  communicate with folks for any length of time.  The ""plan"" was that  someday, I can make enough money with solo game  development to finally  get off of disability and ""make something of  myself"". This still has yet  to pass and seems hopeless at this  particular moment of my life. The  depression from all this, and the  need to depend on the government, has  left me in a dark place that I  simply cannot find my way out of. I'm in  no danger of self-harm or  anything like that but my life seems  increasingly less meaningful and I  really don't know the answer to this.

Anyhow,   I wanted to give you a little background on where my life is now  before  diving in to where my life was then. I guess I'm writing all  this  simply because I don't know what else to do with my life. Perhaps   someday, somehow this will help someone and bring some meaning to my   existence.

# -My Biological Father-

I   was born in Cleveland, Ohio a premature baby of 9 weeks back in 1981.   At this time, I was in real danger of not surviving, as a few organs   (most notably my lungs) had apparently not fully developed. I spent 3   weeks in an oxygen tank (which ruined my eyesight, from what I've been   told) without being able to be held or any actual touch. They had those   glove-things that you could stick your hands into the tank with... this   was the extent of my human contact for those first crucial weeks. I   often wonder how much of all that has attributed to my social failings /   overall mental health.

My father  I  know only by name and very little else. I have several half-siblings  I  don't even know the names of, let alone any way of contacting them.  He  (my Dad) left my mother a couple of months after my birth. Details  are  very sparse about what exactly happened. My mother doesn't talk  about it  and I've not been able to find out much from anyone. She  moved, with  me, to a very small Pennsylvania community where she grew  up and I spent  the first 7 or 8  years of my life there. I obviously  remember nothing  from those first several years and don't have a clue  what my dad even  looks like. It could be worse (and it did get worse)  but this all still  haunts me.

# -My Adopted Father-

This   is where the trouble really started. When I was 5 or 6, my mother had   married her high school sweetheart, who had then adopted me. I very   vaguely remember being in court for this and telling the judge I wanted   him to be my daddy. Afterwards, he had got me a toy shotgun that fired   nerf pellets (I remember it being very realistic... strange gift for a   5-6 year old).

Some length of  time  after all this, my first solid memories, things had gone to hell   quickly. My dad (I'll just call him ""Steve"", not his real name for the   record.) became (or had been all along, I'm not sure) an alcoholic. I   remember vividly him yelling and hitting my mother all the time. These   beatings often came my way too. He had a leather belt with studded holes   he often used. Steve also liked using a 2x4 slab of wood he had  hanging  in the stairway leading to the basement with the words ""The  Peacemaker""  carved and burnt into the wood. I still remember how it  smelled. I  remember the sound of the basement door opening. He'd call  me and my  mother all sorts of things and the beatings were relentless. I  was told  to tell people I had fallen down the stairs (no one once had  questioned  the near-constant bruises I had).

One   particularly bad day, Steve had been beating my mother as per the  norm.  This time was a lot more violent than the previous ones I have  memory  of. He ended up grabbing his favorite shotgun and threatening my  mom  with it. I ran to her when I saw this and (I still can't believe  this  part and it still terrifies and disgusts me to this day) seeing  me, she  grabbed me and used me as a human shield to put between her and  Steve.  The shotgun was pointed between the both of us, being loaded  moments  earlier. Things are really fuzzy after this all happened. I'm  not sure  how long passed before my memories resume.

After   this event and <insert length of time I'm uncertain of with  whatever  happening that I have no memory of>, she ended up divorcing  him. We  moved into a small studio apartment, her and I. This would be  the  happiest moment of my life. It's all been downhill from here. We  used to  stay up late watching MTV and VH1 (back when they actually  played  music), Wrestling matches (Jake the Snake Roberts era), crappy  action  movies, and my first taste of horror flicks. She would laugh,  sing, and  was the happiest I've ever seen her as well.

This   went on from the time I was 8 or so until I was 12. She returned to   Steve very briefly somewhere in there, getting pregnant with my   half-sister in the process. My sister and I don't speak. She witnessed   the proceeding abuses but never was a major part of them. I'm thankful   for that much. Steve spoiled the living hell out of her, turning her   into a spoiled, money-grabbing, vengeful and spiteful person. She   reminds me so much of Steve's worst personality traits that we don't   communicate whatsoever.

A year   ago, Steve went into the backyard in the middle of the night, shotgun in   hand, and ended his life. This was 30 years after the abuse and   everything that transpired after. To this day, I don't know if I'm glad   or if I'm sad that he's gone. I feel nothing. The only emotions I have   is wondering if he thought of us... if we were the reason he killed   himself. I guess I'll never know the answer to this.

# -My Step-Father-

My   mom eventually married another abusive asshole. We'll call him ""Tony""   (again, not his real name). Tony was an ex-Navy vet, having served for   20 years. He was a hard-ass, no-nonsense, you do what I say or you will   get smacked down kind of fellow. The only nice thing I can say about  him  is that he wasn't an alcoholic. Interestingly enough, he also  sported a  belt with studded holes (must be an abuser thing? odd,  that.).

I  was 12, I think, when  she married Tony. She remained with him long  after I had evicted myself  from all that, I think she divorced when I  was 20. I wasn't speaking  with her during this time and didn't for many  years after. I blamed her  for a lot of the abuse... with Tony, she would  often participate and  encourage him to continue the beatings after he  was ""done"", prompting  more. She woke up drinking and didn't stop until  she slept. She still  drinks like this 20+ years later; I'm fairly  certain this will be the  cause of her death.

Not  much to  say here except for a repeat of the same type of beatings I got  from  Steve. I'd still make up excuses in high school to explain my  marks  from them; I was only asked twice the entirety of my schooling,  though  the marks were nearly ever-present.

The   beatings would occur if I farted the wrong way; there was always a   ""reason"" for them and they happened at least weekly. When I was 15, I   stood up to him once. This was a bad idea. He smacked me full-force   across the head/face, knocking me on the ground. He punched me in the   stomach, threw me into the wall, and choked me, lifting me a good 8   inches off the ground while he did so. I must have passed out; I don't   remember much of anything after this.

# -Drug and Alcohol Abuse-

I   started smoking cigarettes at age 12. I started drinking at 13. I   smoked pot at 14, and it went downhill from there. The moment I turned   16, I went to court and emancipated myself from my mother and Tony. I   quit school that same day and moved in with a gay man in his late 50's   that I worked with at the local grocery store.

From   here, my drug use spiraled fast. I had a direct connection to a  chemist  in Pittsburgh and would get LSD for ""cost"". This ended up being  between  $1.50 and $2 a hit. It was some high-grade liquid geltabs,  often a  green color, and towards the end of my LSD bender I was doing  between  12-15 hits at once.

I  would roam  the streets, alone, in the middle of the night and think my  LSD  thoughts. I once tried to write them down. I wish I still had those   writings, the ramblings of a mad-man with eyes too far open.

My   friend, whom I introduced to this chemist, ended up dealing the LSD   locally. Seeing a few hundred to thousands of hits of acid became   commonplace. I became ""respected"" by the other druggies getting their   hits to escape reality for a while. These were actually good times.

My   friend had unknowingly been selling books (hits in the thousands) to  an  undercover cop for a year. Most likely, I was also under  investigation,  though I never actually sold anything to anyone besides  my very closest  friends. They eventually arrested him and he went to  prison for 10  years. I lost track of him after that and stopped my LSD  use.

Unfortunately, that wasn't the end of the drugs.

I   started doing cocaine and, on several occasions, smoking crack. I did   lines upon lines of pills; uppers, downers, pain meds... it didn't   matter to me so long as it fucked me up. I smoked PCP once. I smoked   meth once. Pot was there from waking until sleeping.

Honestly,   I don't even know if I was working or not during this. I only remember   the drugs. I passed up SO many meaningful relationships, had a few   around me die from suicide and overdosing. One of my very close friends   had spent the night; he seemed very happy and I would NEVER have   expected the next day. He hung himself in a public park from a support   beam in a covered bench area. I know exactly where it is and when I   lived there, would visit the spot often and smoke a bowl in his memory.

I'm often very, very surprised I didn't overdose myself. I remember many, **many**   instances of being so fucked up I'd pass out... the edges of my vision   going black and slowly tunneling in until there was nothing but  silence.

Alcohol  was also a  constant from age 16 to my late 20's. I'm not entirely sure  when I  stopped. I don't remember a lot towards the end. Bit and pieces  of  stories that stood out, things that happened, people I met. Not much   else.

At 18, I had a DUI. I drove a   Saab 900 Turbo, stick shift. I loved that car. One day I had lost my   job at Radio Shack. I don't recall why; either the social anxiety,   panicking, or the drugs/alcohol. Possibly all. Details aren't known. I   decided to drive to a dam I used to hang out at. This was around 10pm or   something. I had a friend with me and we drank a case of beer and a   bottle of... something? I can't remember what now. We were both **very**   intoxicated and decided to drive back to my parents house as I didn't   think we'd make it back to mine. This was only a mile or so away.

I   took a dirt road that I always used to drive on and knew it like the   back of my hand. Unfortunately, they had recently laid down gravel on   one of the (sharp) turns on the road, unbeknownst to me. The police   report said I was going approximated 95 miles an hour around the curve,   lost control hitting the ditch on the right side of the road, then over   correcting into a steep bank on the left side of the road. This sent  me  into a roll, which ejected my friend from the sunroof. He broke his   sternum from this. I remained in the car during the wreck, flipping at   least 6 or 7 times by my estimate (the distance was around 200 feet)  and  smashed the drivers side hard into a tree, crumpling the car into a   mangled mess. I don't know how I survived.

A   period of time later, I emerged from the car (I'm not sure how long I   was out). We both tried to walk back to my house... I didn't get more   than a few dozen feet before realizing how badly I was injured. We   stopped at the nearest house, pounded on the door until someone answered   (this was at least 2am, if not later), and got an ambulance called.   This whole time, blood is gushing my head, covering my face and my eyes.   I still remember my sight as the blood continued to get in my eyes no   matter how much I tried to wipe it away.

I   passed out somewhere in here. I remember waking up for just a few   moments in the ambulance, apologized to them for the trouble I was   causing them, and didn't wake up again until 2 days later. I had severe   head trauma, 7 broken ribs, a chip off my kneecap (which later would be   operated on), and covered from head to toe in cuts and bruises. They   weren't sure if I was going to make it, from what my mother told me.   There was a distinct possibility I was going to be brain dead.

I   remember waking up, seeing my mother at the foot of the bed with her   weeping, and I was completely unable to say anything. My mouth was   trying so hard to form the words I wanted to say but nothing came out. I   passed back out again after this for an unknown length of time.

When   I finally regained consciousness fully, the doctors wanted to keep me   there to run more tests, etc. They refused to let me go outside to have  a  cigarette, so I (very stupidly) checked myself out and walked out.

For   a very long time after that (again, unknown but I'm guessing at least a   year), I had to re-wire the way I thought. I can't really explain it   much better than that. I don't have many memories of this, minus bits   and pieces (a running theme in my life). I just remember having a very   difficult time forming clear thoughts; not like I wanted to anyhow at   that point.

The drugs and alcohol continued after this event, if anything making it all spiral faster.

I   barely ate. I barely slept. I remember only bits and pieces from these   years. I'm not entirely sure how long this lasted. Well into my 20's.

A   part of me misses this. The sweet release of realization that my life   is what it has become. I miss the people. I miss the girls. I miss   laughing at nothing with them, listening to trance music with a blown   mind from the LSD and ecstasy. I miss the naked, pure moments where   nothing mattered but the touch of one another... the whispers... the   free-spirited love that passed between us all. It should be noted that   all this very rarely involved sex; this was more of a mental-fucking. I   miss the smells, the sights, the delightful bliss of a world perceived   through the lens of heavy drugs.

I'm   not proud of any of this. It still has it effects on my life, even   today, 10+ years after quitting that lifestyle. Eventually I stopped   because people I loved were dying from all this; **\_I\_** was dying from all this, a day at a time.

# -Sexual Abuse-

Which   brings me to the darkest and most-hidden-from-myself aspect to my life  -  the sexual abuse. I only remember bits and pieces of all this. I'm  not  sure how long it went on. I'm **VERY** certain there is a lot more to this that I have buried deeper than I can see.... call it a hunch.

The   first instance of this was when my mother was married to Steve. I used   to go to my grandfather's house after school when I was too young to   look after myself (from age 12-14, I think. I'm not entirely sure about   the time-frame). My two uncles also lived there, one of them younger   than me and one of them a few years older.

I   hated it there. It was a half-mile from the house I lived in, in the   absolute middle of nowhere with only two homes on the way there. The   house was derelict, decrepit, smelly, every possible inch of it had   cracked, peeling paint. The yard was covered in junk, old tractors that   no longer worked, motorbikes and bicycles long-rusted from the rain, a   junkyard dog that my uncles often ridiculed and, on more than one   occasion, kicked. I hated the second floor; junk from many years of   god-knows-what crammed into 3 rooms up to the ceiling. I hated the   smells, something I can still smell even now as I type this.

They   had cattle they raised for a slaughterhouse auction every year. My   uncles (and my grandfather, probably on more than one occasion but one   that I remember) used to walk the length of the fence and use a cattle   prod on any cows that were around. They would laugh their asses off at   this.

To this day, I don't   remember my response to any of this. I just remember the disgust, shock,   anger and sadness I still feel. Remembering and writing this all down   is one of the hardest things I've done.

\*sighs\*   And now, the hardest part of my tale. The thing that haunts my   memories, makes me scream in my dreams, and has formed a deep distrust   and fear of most people.

There was   a (equally horrible) barn in the back of the property where they would   store hay for the cows. It had a beat-up wooden ladder leading to a   small overhang on the ""second floor"" (if you could call it that. It was   10 feet across, if that, and had no railing or anything to prevent   falling off of it). There were hay bails up there as well, stacked at   least a dozen feet up to the roof, blocking anyone from seeing up there.

My   uncle would take me up there and force me to give him hand jobs. This   eventually lead to him forcing me to give him head. He threatened that   he'd tell everyone at school (again, he was only a couple of years  older  than me) that I was a ""faggot"" if I ever mentioned this to  anyone. He  told me he'd not only beat me up, but kill my other uncle if  I ever  told.

I never did, until  now, with  only a very close few people to me knowing this. I don't know  how many  times this happened. I don't know if my grandfather also had a  hand in  my abuse during these times. I remember so very little from it  all.

My  uncle had a friend. I  remember he had the most piercing blue eyes. He  used to take me into  the pasture, far away from the home, and make me do  the same. I don't  know if my uncle told him about me or if it was a  sick coincidence that  the same methods of coercion were used.

From   what I understand (memories are so foggy from here), my younger uncle   also was abused by this friend. I think he may have told someone as   there was a huge blowout at one point. I don't really know the details   but I know nothing ever really happened from it other than the friend   not coming around for several years.

Lastly, and perhaps most disturbing, my gay roommate in his late 50's....

This   happened sometime before I moved out, I would spend the night there  all  the time at age 14-15 until I moved in at 16. He would buy alcohol  and  pot and get me and my friends completely wasted. He'd hit on me **all the time.** This all started at age 14. I guess, in retrospect, he was completely and totally grooming me.

I   don't remember the full extent of this (sorry, it's so, so far buried)   but during the times he'd get me completely wasted, I remember a  couple  of times waking up in a drunken haze to him giving my 14-15 year  old  self (VERY intoxicated and sleeping) a blowjob. I never let him  know I  was awake... I was too much in shock and didn't know what to do.  I felt  like it was my fault because I didn't stop him. I was too  terrified of  what would happen if I did... would he be more aggressive?  Would he make  me do more things? So I faked that I was sleeping.

I   continued to stay over and eventually move in because the other  option,  getting the shit beat out of me, seemed like the greater evil. I  wish I  could remember more yet at the same time completely blessed  that I  don't.

I don't know much  more than  this... I know there's a lot more but I simply can't  remember; it's too  far buried, likely for my own good.

Because of all this, I **hate** men (no offense to any reading this, please don't take it that way). I can't be around them for any length of time.

I'm   blessed in that I'm not more sexually fucked up than I am... I'm   thankful that I can have a normal relationship with women without all   this fucking me up more than it has mentally.

# -Conclusion-

The   last 10 years have been a downward spiral of another type. I can't   focus anymore on anything for very long. It's so hard for me to find   happiness and when I do have it, it's often very fleeting. I feel   useless. I can't work due to the constant panic attacks and leave my   house only when I need to (although lately, I've been trying SO hard to   fix that. I recently moved to Pittsburgh to a new place where I know no   one and am far away from everything and everyone that caused me so  much  pain.). I don't have hope for the future anymore and just kind of   ""live"".

I've been depressed most   of my life but this is a different spiral that I'm not sure how to   explain. I'm tired. There's things that I want I can't even describe and   there's experiences out there I desire, again that I cannot explain   with words.

I don't know where this road is going to lead me, if anywhere, and I'm just.... spent.

This is my tale, my life, my tragedies. There's been some **great**   people that I've met along the way and so many, many more that I let   slip through my fingers which I regret and think about a lot. I don't   know where things go from here and I'm lost, tired, and scared.

2711,"""The Unspoken Truth""- A short story about my personal experiences with anxiety and depression  Understandably, I'm a bit hesitant posting my short story on here for the whole world to see. I'm no writer of any sort (obviously) so apologies if the grammar is not 100%. With that out the way, I started this just for myself with no intention other than to be a coping mechanism. However, further down the line I started to realise that this could potentially help other people who go through the same difficulties on a daily basis and most importantly, could raise a huge awareness upon mental illness. Evidently, mental illnesses are not often talked about, but often brushed under the carpet and almost frowned upon. Because of this, this creates a humongous amount of stigma attached to this topic which can result in a person feeling even more embarrassed or ashamed; which of course they should never be made to feel. I hope this gives you an insight into what it's like living with a mental illness on a daily basis, hope you enjoy the read!

‚ÄúIt's exhausting having to fight a war inside of your head.‚Äù
Imagine this. Your heart is racing at what feels like two thousand beats per minute. Both fists clenched into a tight, tight ball. Sweating, from every existing gland in your body. Palms so wet whilst instantaneously losing grip of everything you touch. Confusion, nothing makes sense as thoughts are rushing around in your head from every direction, disturbing your vision as you do everything in your power to see straight. A tight ball like feeling in your throat, so tight that you cannot breath. It‚Äôs the feeling you experience when the edge of a crisp gets stuck in your throat, slowly and painfully cutting your glands. A sick like feeling, wanting to let it go but doing what you can to keep it back. Don‚Äôt embarrass yourself like this, not if people are watching. Now onto the chest. Feeling so tight and heavy as if someone is standing on top of you, crushing you with every power and strength within them, whilst you pant and gasp for air and catch each and every breath that your body allows you to. Shaking, crying, sweating, tensing, shivering, trembling. And now slowly breathe with every bit of energy that is left in you. You are fine, you are alive and it‚Äôs over for now. 

The brain is a complex thing, just as complex as ones human mentality. The limbic system controls emotions within the human brain, there's no surprise that at the best of times you feel as if you have a complete lack of control over your emotional and mental state. The brain is so incredibly complex that it often even puzzles scientists; the same people who allowed the first human beings into space and onto the moon. The same people who are able to clone living and breathing animals, create satellites for outer space, discover electricity, gravity, evolution, DNA. And yet, they fail to completely understand the human brain and each function that is involved and why they are involved. Many people fail to realise that not everyone thinks in the same way, not one person has the same thought process as another human being walking this earth. What may seem logical and rational to one human being may seem completely and utterly bizarre to another. 

There is a fine line between feeling lonely and being alone. In the depths of the night when the sun has set and there is nothing to see in the deep sky apart from the twinkling of the bright stars. Hearing the occasional sound of a car passing by, the tree leaves lightly tap-taping against the window due to the slight breeze in the dead of night. The sirens that wake the streets; whilst people question if a life has just been taken from us, or is it that a life is about to enter our world of mystery? At night, when people lay asleep with their heads softly against their pillow, you lay there gazing at the ceiling, unable to sleep, wondering to yourself what you could have done differently that day. Sleep. 7 to 8 hours of sleep they say. But what if you can't sleep due to the constant thoughts and feelings rushing through your head from that day, from weeks, months, even years ago. The mind is a dangerous place, a place that I fear as I know it is stronger and more powerful than I am. Have you ever been surrounded my so many people, so many bodies, but felt so lost. Helpless. Alone. Questioning how the silence can be so loud. Lost in thought, whilst hearing the mummers of those surrounding you. 

Imagine feeling a prisoner of your own body. The only body you will have for as long as you may live. The body that will grow and cherish into something beautiful at adolescence. The body that will make love to another body, feeling each and every edge and crevice. The body that will see into the eyes of their loved one, touch their hand, smell their recognisable scent, one that comforts them with ease. The body that will taste their sweet lips and the body that will hear their touching and soothing voice gently in their ear. The human body is a remarkable thing, each and every one unique and different in every way, shape and form. But what happens when you start to lose control of your body, the one body that is yours and no one else's. When your bones feel weak and your limbs like jelly. Like you're floating on a cloud, uncertain about those sweet lips you once kissed, those gentle voices you once heard, the feel and warmth of the person you love turn to cold, the smell no longer there and their eyes unfamiliar with fear. You start to lose everything you once remembered, everything you once cared for and everything that your body allowed you to do. Eventually, they all just become distant memories. All the people you have met become lost faces. 

Time. Time is inevitable. Too little time, or too much time? Should you be too early, or just on time? Time is a concept made up by human beings. The sun rising suggests it is morning time, the sun setting however, you guessed, implies that the day is coming to a close and all is left is the dark night's sky. What if there were no such thing as time? Would people be less stressed, less rushed, less busy? What would people do to insure they are being kept occupied? How would the world go on? When you become lonely, sad, anxious, depressed; time works in two of which ways. Time either stands still or in contrast, goes as fast as lightning and by the time you know it, you lose track of where you are, what you have done, even who you are. On average, it takes a human being 2o muscles to smile and 50 muscles to frown. Yet, why are there so many people spending their days crying, worrying, distressed surrounding themselves in pity and self doubt. If it takes such little muscles to create a smile, how does it become so hard for someone to put one together. Their smile may be imperfect, broken or even jiggered, but it is still a smile that may bring delight into someone's bleak day. A smile has the power to touch someone's heart, touch someone's soul. Imagine, for whatever reason you felt as if you could no longer smile without it feeling fake, like a scam. Seeing another smile, a smile of a friend, a loved one, even a stranger; can bring you so much joy and happiness to someone.

Breathing. An essential, necessary part of life. Any life. We all breath, if it wasn't for our power to breath none of us would be here, would exist, the world would be an empty, lonely shell. But what if with every breath you take, your lungs feel like they are filled with water. Like someone is crushing your windpipe, struggling to breath without the aid of another existence. Each breath getting slower, harder, faster, slower, faster, harder. Until you can no longer take it anymore. Until you collapse in a ball, questioning the why's and the what's and the who's. Whoever put me on this earth, whatever is out there, why me? To breath like another human being, that's all that I ask of you. 

Excuses, excuses, excuses. I can't say I'm anxious, I already said that last week, and the week before, and probably the week before that too. I'll say that I'm ill, yes, just ill. No questions asked, just ill. That way, I won't look lazy to them. I won't have to explain myself, why I'm feeling this way. The reality is, I don't even know myself. How do you explain that to someone when you can't get the right words out? When nothing you say will make sense, when you don't know why you're up and you're down, all day every day. How do you explain that to someone on the outside? That it's a constant cycle of emotions. That, however much you try you cannot leave your bed. That each step you take that day, all you are looking forward to is returning to your room, surrounded by darkness and crawling back into bed. Sleeping. Your safe place, where no one can disturb you, not even the cars outside, the voices echoing the streets, the sound of the metro line, Because you are alone with your thoughts in the darkness, until you slowly drift off into a long sleep. Too little sleep or not enough, there is no in between and no matter what, tiredness always wins. It defeats you, laughs at you and mocks you. Tiredness is a silent killer. It waits until you are energised, finally feeling happy until it creeps out on you from nowhere, like burred treasure among the sands over the blue, clear waters. 

Panic. What do I do with my day? Slowly awaken, shower to wake up the mind, the body the soul. Get ready and feeling good, quick look in the mirror, today could be a good day. Ready. Panic. What do I do now? When was the last time I ate? Am I eating because I'm hungry, or because I know it's the right thing to do? Because my body needs the nutrients in order to survive. Baby steps. No more routines, I'm free to the world but the freedom is almost suffocating. Procrastinate. Endless hours upon hours doing nothing but everything, trying to eat, trying to breath, trying to be normal. The skies are getting dark and the streets are becoming quieter. Time to sleep, my favourite part. Dreams, dreams about love, romance, the best days of your life so far. Woken up suddenly with what feels like a tonne of bricks hitting against your forehead. Awaken, get ready, repeat. 

Coldness. It creeps up on you, sending tingles and shivers all throughout your body. From your neck down to the depths of your spine, through your legs, your arms, to the tips of your fingers and your toes until you slowly start to feel like a stray dog, left all alone on a cold winter‚Äôs night. No owner, no food, no home, nothing. You are left feeling like nothing, invisible. Invisible to yourself, your neighbours, your friends. Would anyone notice if I were to go? Leave this place, this town, this city, this world and never look back? Who would miss me? No. That isn't me talking, I am fine. I am no longer in control of my emotions; I have been taken over by a rush of coldness and hotness all at one. Confusion. Why is it so hard to think straight, to see straight, to be normal. What is normal, if there is such thing?

‚ÄúPatience is a virtue‚Äù, one of my favourite sayings. To have patience with someone shows that you care. You are passionate about what they have to say. Their thoughts, feelings, emotions, ideas, philosophies. It puts things into perspective, indulges you with new knowledge and education. Feeds your brain in more ways than you realise. You almost start to care more about their ideas than your own, as you analyse in explicit detail their body language, every hand gesture, movement. You start to become at one with them. But what if, however, you have an astounding amount of patience with these people, but not with yourself. Not with your emotions, your feelings, your thoughts, even your movements. You brush them under the carpet, pretend they're not there. I mean, they're not visible to the naked eye, so no one would notice otherwise. Right? Wrong. Emotions matter, feelings matter. However big, small, funny, comical. We are human beings and as human beings, we must come together. But what do you do when you no longer recognise yourself? The person standing in front of the mirror, that isn't the same person from a few weeks, months, years ago. That smile. That smile that once lit the room has been replaced with something bleak. I wouldn't call it a smile, just a crook of the face. Those eyes. Those eyes that were once filled with joy, now filled with emptiness and water from the never ending tears that are wept throughout the night. Those hands. Those hands that would be used to ride a bike for the first time, draw, paint, now tremble at the whirlwind of thoughts, sweat among the constant pit of sorrow and anxiety and continue to tremble. What happened to her? The twinkle in her eye has disappeared. She looks sad, bewildered, as she looks out into the huge, never-ending world before her.

I couldn't face people today, what if I mess up? What if I embarrass myself? But why should I care, they are strangers who I will most likely never see again. Oh, but what if I do? Would they remember, would they care? Thoughts spinning round in my head. It's wanting to go out, but not wanting to socialise. Wanting to be successful, but being afraid of failure. Wanting long lasting relationships, but not wanting to show people your real self, your self-pity, self-loathing, sad self. It's wanting to eat, but not physically being able to. It's waning to go for a walk, a run, but not having the energy to. It's wanting to go to a party, wanting to get dressed up, but not wanting to make small talk with people, strangers. It's wanting to be productive, but not wanting to get up on a morning. It's wanting to sleep, wanting to shut down, but finding every distraction you can to stop yourself. It's wanting to be happy, but spoiling it for yourself, knowing it won't last for long as the next thing is always around the corner. The next headache, the next bad news, the next anything. It's wanting to be surrounded by people, familiar, comforting faces and places, but wanting nothing but to isolate yourself from the world, alone in your room. It's wanting to travel somewhere new, but not wanting to risk it in case you feel trapped with nowhere to run, no way to get home, no way to get back to your safe haven. It's finding excuses not to do things, not to go places, not to travel, see the world surrounding us. It's finding it easier talking online, through text, as it is in real life. It's feeling not lonely, but alone, with no way to escape the epitome of darkness.

It‚Äôs an indescribable feeling. A feeling that doesn‚Äôt quite go, doesn‚Äôt leave your body and is somehow, always there. A feeling I wouldn‚Äôt wish upon anyone, not even the most extreme prisoners. I bet they feel alone, too. Not just a prisoner literally, but mentally. Wishing they could turn back time and be surrounded by friends, family and those closest to them. Instead, they are surrounded by the heavy metal bars that keep them away from society, isolated with only their thoughts. Being a prisoner of your own mind is a dangerous thing. It‚Äôs always far easier to just tell people ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired‚Äù when they ask how you are, how you are feeling. Because it‚Äôs the truth. Physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted. It drains the life from your bones, the happiness from your blood and the soul from your veins. You no longer feel human, like a living and breathing being. You just exist, you are just there. 

Wouldn't it be nice to be young again. To be care free, innocent, knowing nothing but happiness and peace in the world. Cherishing every joyous memory with friends, staying up late watching cartoons. Having no worries, no cares in the world. The only problems we faced were those of the anticipating moments, wondering if we would get our first detention for handing in late homework, or forgetting to underline the date and the title. Oh how clumsy of us! Going home from school wondering if today was the day that the boy from school finally noticed you. Unaware of the evil out there. The violence, the war. The people that were once here, once had families, but lost their battle and couldn't find the light at the end of the darkness. The racism, the religious slurs that leave the mouths of the uneducated, the ignorant. These same mouths that start their day sipping on Chinese tea, getting ready as they put on their Indian shirt and Thai, suede shoes. Wrapping their Swiss watch around their wrist, as time for him is money. Leaving the day behind drinking their Russian vodka, French wine, German beer. Oh the irony. I didn't know about mental illness until twelve years old. Experienced my first panic attack at fourteen years old. Understandably, assuming I was having a fit, heaving a heart attack, dying. What was happening to my body? To my emotions? So powerful and overwhelming that I could not simply control them on my own. If I had known sooner, had a deeper understanding surrounding mental illness; it could have saved me so many sleepless nights. How is it fair that in school, in life, we are only taught about those serious physical illnesses? Broken limbs and body parts, cancer, diabetes, chronic pain, Sclerosis, lung disease, heart disease; the list goes on. However, the views and attitudes towards mental illnesses and disease are not viewed in the same light. Why? Why are they brushed under the carpet so often when they can have such a huge impact upon a person‚Äôs life and state of mind? Their ability to enter the real world, form friendships, relationships. Do the simplest of tasks that one with no mental illness would class as the 'norm'. The stigma upon mental illness as a whole is one of the main reasons hundreds, thousands and millions of people are suffering alone, in silence. If I had a broken leg, a broken arm, people would instantly notice me among the crowd. A person's mental complexity is not always recognisable; it can be in any one of us, any 'normal' looking person. Stand a person with a broken limb next to a person with a mental health disorder. Who will get the most empathy, I wonder. The feeling is almost paralysing. It's like learning to walk again, talk again, breath again, live again. 

I managed to leave the house today. It wasn't for long, but I did it. I managed to eat today, too. It wasn't much, but it filled my stomach and my body later thanked me for it. The feeling is still there, but today as I write this, I feel empowered. I feel positive within myself. Earphones in, ignoring the world. Treasuring every moment I can, as I know it won't last as much as I anticipated. The trembling is back, throughout my whole body. So much so that my whole body is numb, almost as if I have been laid in an ice cold bath for hours, days, weeks. The coldness is almost painful, taking over my body. False persona. We all like to show people how well we are doing. We are all guilty of it without even realising. Sharing our lives with complete strangers across the world, throughout various social networks. It's almost like we seek approval from these strangers, thinking it will someone benefit our character or life after we upload that picture, status, post. When really, we are the same person when we go to sleep that night. We are still the same people. Nothing has changed but our ego. Why do we do this to ourselves? It's like we so desperately crave the attention from strangers when the people who care about us most are surrounded us. But maybe sometimes, that isn't enough. And sometimes, it's almost as if we are all living in a fantasy dream world. 

I can't do this anymore; I'm giving up, losing hope. I thought people called them happy pills for a reason. So, why am I feeling so low? So much lower than before. I can't sleep at night. I'm scared to sleep at night as I'm afraid of what tomorrow will bring. What if I waste another day? Imagine that, being afraid to sleep, afraid to wake up on a morning. I spent today looking at four walls. In the room I am confined in, cry in, sleep in, and dream in. It's my comfort, but it's also my prison- my enemy. I couldn‚Äôt eat today, the lump in my throat was too big, it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to. I want to eat, but I can‚Äôt. I also want to sleep, but I can‚Äôt. ‚ÄúYou could be worse‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúJust smile‚Äù ‚ÄúYou will be fine‚Äù. Since when was my mental state something to be compared to? Those words are degrading, humiliating and ignorant. Because I am still here, because my scars have healed, because there isn't a noose tied around my neck. That's enough evidence for them. I'm still here. Still breathing, living, showing my face; so I must be fine, right? Oh, they couldn't be more wrong. You cannot simply compare mental illness so lightly, as if you are comparing fractions in a maths equation. We are not numbers, we are human beings. Each person fighting their own battle. Why do we also tend to glamorize mental illness? Why is it seen almost like a new trend? Like they somehow make a person cute, but an awkward cute. There is nothing beautiful about a mental illness. They are ugly, they are evil, they are soul destroying. They keep you awake at night and make you question every aspect about yourself; your mind, appearance, your body. They make you question why you are not good enough. Why you are not like the others your age. I would rather have nothing at all and wake up every morning happy and energised, than carry the weight of a mental illness on my shoulders, weighing me down in all that I do. However, I am not and will not be defined by my mental illness, it is a part of me, my life. Where I go, it will follow, but I refuse to allow it to steal my identity. 

It makes you fear the world. Fear the future. Even fear yourself; your mind, thoughts, feelings. You isolate yourself from the world, your friends and the people closest to you who you care for the most. It makes you silent. It takes your voice, your passion. Until you are sat there, weak and lifeless. I wonder what it's like. To wake up on a morning, take a shower, put on your clothes and get ready for the day without a thousand and one thoughts whirling around in your head like a never-ending cycle. I wonder what it feels like to wake up on a morning without a headache, without the urge of wanting to vomit. I wonder what it's like to live an ordinary life. One where you don't over think every minuscule detail. One where you are able to leave you house without panic or fear. One where you are able to walk down the street not being paranoid that everyone is staring at you. Do I have toothpaste around my mouth? Food on my chin? I wonder what it's like to be sat in a crowded room, a loud crowded bus without feeling suffocated. Without wanting to leave as quickly and as desecrate as possible. I wonder what it's like to not have to lie. When someone asks how you are doing to not respond with ‚ÄúI'm just tired‚Äù, but to tell them exactly how you are feeling. I wonder what it's like to not wake up with eyelids so tired that they struggle to stay open, struggle to stay awake. I wonder what it's like to go about your day, questioning ho much sleep you think you'll be able to have tonight. Will it be 4 hours? 5 hours? Maybe 6 if we're lucky. I wonder what it's like to be optimistic about the future and not dwell on the past. I wonder what it feels like to say you're happy without having to fake a smile. I wonder what it's like to be in love with your body, every curve and edge. I wonder what it's like not crying in the shower, most if not every day. I've forgotten the last time I didn't feel constantly drained, exhausted. To not wake up every day with the same headache, feeling the same as I did the night before. I've forgotten what it feels like to get dressed on a morning, eat breakfast, without it feeling like an accomplishment. 

I visited my old school the other week. It brought back so many memories. The place I was taught about new ways of thinking, new ideologies. The place I grew, developed and matured. The place I learnt a lot, not just in Maths, Science and English, but about myself. The place I created and developed new, exciting friendships. Friendships that still continue to grow six years later. It's an odd place is school. It's a place where you experience the best time of your life, but to contrast that, the most challenging and difficult times you will face. Isn't it funny how each person is categorised into groups, into status, into 'coolness'. But, in five, ten, twenty years time, the status you once had, the popularity you once gained will no longer mean anything. In the real world, people don't like you for the popular image that you depict of yourself. They like you for being a humble, genuine and kind person. Well, that's how it should be anyway. School can be a challenging time for those who feel alone, feel as if they don't fit in, like the black sheep among the crowd. I remember my first day of my new high school like it was only last week. Year nine, thirteen years old, the age that everyone has already made their friends, already known each other, already knowing the school like the back of their hand. I had never felt so lost. Leaving my friends and family behind. My lovely, beautiful Grandma. Who the next time I would see, would sadly no longer be here. having to start a new life up here, with unfamiliar faces, unfamiliar voices. I hated being the new girl, I never did like drawing attention to myself. What if nobody would like me? What if people were to laugh at my accent and not be able to understand me? A hundred and one thoughts whirled around in my head that morning, as I put on my new white crisp shirt and fastened my long, navy tie. 

I was lucky. I was treated with kindness, respect and loyalty from these people, these people that had never met me before. For once in my life, I felt apart of something, apart of a bubbly and comical friendship group; I knew it was something I would latch onto. They made my days better, more entertaining. Cheering me up when I would get bursts of anxiety, missing my one best friend back at home who was nearly three hours away; ninety two miles to be exact. One phone call away, that's all it would take. But it would never compare to the comfort of her voice, her being, her warmth. Nine years of friendship to be turned into conversations on Facebook, on text, with just the blur of her photo to be seen. Nothing can compare to the love you have for your closest, dearest friends. Those friends that would do anything to see you happy, see you smile, walk the ends of the earth for you. Keep them close, as their love is eternal and I personally, am eternally grateful. 

School was going well, my work and understanding of each subject was also going well. But for some reason, there was an unfamiliar cloud of darkness hovering over me, overwhelming me with a mix of emotions that I didn't quite understand. Tears pouring down face at unexpected times, unsure why Embarrassment, as people would show their concern, asking what the matter what, but I simply couldn't reply as I didn't know myself what was wrong. I had nice friends, a support network, great family, a new bigger house with my own huge bedroom, everything I could need. So what was the matter? Why would I come home from school with tears filling my eyes, so sad and confused? What else would I need? What could I do possibly to fill this emptiness in my head, in my stomach, in my life. I was thirteen years old, I knew I shouldn't be feeling like this. I should be out making memories with my friends, not feeing alone, feeling this way. Time passed and my confidence grew. Although I knew at the back of mind something wasn't quite right, I still pushed myself and acted as if things were normal. I didn't want people to see me like this, see me so weak, like a burden to people. I just wanted to be a normal teenage girl, who would go to sleepovers with- friends, eat too much ice-cream at midnight until she felt sick and giggle herself into a deep sleep. I was a joker. Would make people laugh until they could hardly breath. I liked seeing people smile because of me. Laugh at me. Not at me, but with me. I enjoyed bringing happiness into other people's lives, as it made up for the happiness that was absent in my own. While all of my friends would spend their weekends being sociable, visiting cinemas, parks, town, I would spend most of mine alone, in my room. Watching videos, drawing, eating, to pass time. I remember feeling a bitter jealousy inside of my stomach. Jealous of those friends who could go out, into large crowded areas and enjoy themselves without the heart palpitations, the sweated palms or the sick like feeling in the pit of their stomach.",Relaxed
2712,"The combination of my disease, personality traits and experiences isolates me. I'm so tired of this  Hey there. 

Long story short. I (22F) am an introvert, likely a misanthrope, shy, quite aggressive when something ticks me off, been through traumatic experiences totally controlled by the people's stupidity plus I have schizotypal disorder. 

Each day I can feel myself straying further from the society. I'm too nervous and helpless to make new friends and too tired to maintain the old ones. Also, I'm really good at making enemies by calling people out on their BS. Literally every human interaction wears me out. 

Why can't I be normal? I mean, sometimes I enjoy interacting with others as long as I'm drunk or rested enough. 

It'll be really tough for me when I'm back in the uni. I'll have 2 roommates I'll need to have at least basic contact with, plus the friends that haven't left me yet.

I‚Äôll give a short summary about who I am. I am diagnosed with bpd, turning 23 in a month. I started sinking into depression when I was 13, and two and a half years ago I found my light. My girlfriend, which is in LDR supports me and gives me a safe space after coming from a broken home. Here is the problem. I started healing after my second attempt of ending it when I almost jumped out of a car. I picked up a hobby (magic) and decided to pursue it until I prove everyone else wrong, and that‚Äôs what I did, for two years I practiced for 12 hours a day. After that I went to the army, and met friends for the first time for three years and got my first gf. It didn‚Äôt work with her but it ended well. In the army I got myself into problems because I was chasing highs to the point I ended up getting investigated for using weed. I‚Äôve always chased highs, weather it‚Äôs with magic, music, my army career or the last experience.

After two years of a long distance relationship I flew to meet my gf for two months and I finally felt home. I‚Äôm back in my country now. I‚Äôm trying to get back in shape, and to make money, but emotionally I deal dead inside. I can‚Äôt feel a thing. I can‚Äôt cry anymore. I don‚Äôt feel happiness or pain.

2714,"Anxiety and excitement share the same biological responses.  When you get ""anxious"" also now referred to as ""excited"":

Your hormones shoot up Adrenaline (Epinephrine) which increase your heart rate and alertness. It also shoots up cortisol, which is a stress hormone that is associated with energy.

**The physiological effect:**

* increased heart rate (more blood flowing through your body to provide nutrients).
* increased respiratory rate (rapid breathing to further take in o2 and remove Co2, this also provide more resources to your body).
* sweating (your body cools down to prevent over-heating).
* pupils dilate (this effect makes your eyes taking in more light, which translates to: more visual information and alertness)
* muscle tension (prepares the muscle for physical response)

I can go into deep detail about this, but I'll briefly touch on the neurological response as that get's technical quickly:

* norepinephrine spikes (increased alertness)
* dopamine spikes (pleasure and excitement chemical (neurotransmitter))
* serotonin spike (associated with mood and anxiety regulation)
* gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (another neurotrans that helps with brain activity and can affect anxiety levels (note: GABA is what anxiety medications, such as: Benzodiazepines act on (I highly advise you to avoid BZO though))

**Conclusion:**

Anxiety and excitement are similar as both emotions trigger an increased physiological response (as mentioned above), the key difference between feeling anxious and excited is that you associate the feeling with something threatening or that it might lead to negative outcomes, but you can turn that around and start associating it with desirable events, creating a sense of thrill and anticipation.

Anxiety and excitement is the same emotion, but your association to it determines if it's bad or good. Now every time you get anxious: slowly breath in deeply with your nose, and exhale through your mouth (really fill and empty your lungs) 4-5 times - this trigger your vagus nerve to relax which further calms you down from the high intensity emotion, once calm try getting to know the excitement sensation, learning to be able to stand in it will give you a huge advantage.

I work drastically better in high intensity stress situations, throw me at someone needing EMS treatment and is in critical condition; I feel calm; focused; and content - and the same goes for martial arts, you need to be able to handle high intensity; it's your brain and body preparing you to react to the situation.

2717,"Girlfriend's Parents Killing My Excitement / Vent  I wanna start off by saying my girlfriend has been great and defending me and shutting down their shit when they start. We are both young adults, long distance, and we both currently live with our own parents in different states.

Her parents drive me bananas in the worst way possible, recently it's just been her mom as far as I am aware, but her dad does similar shit. They apparently ""do not believe or understand long distance relationships.""

Her mom got drunk at their family's Thanksgiving and was ""jokingly"" trying to set up my girlfriend with another person, who was ALSO in a long distance relationship. Both of them were trying to explain that to her and I guess it just wasn't getting through to her thick skull. 

We are/were making plans for me to go to her state to visit in the next couple months, I was going to stay with her and her family, and my own mom was going to drive with me but stay in a near by hotel.

Honestly I want to avoid both of her parents as much as possible. I would 10000% prefer her to come up here and visit me instead, but when we tried that, her parents decided they didn't know me well enough to trust either of us and made us cancel it.

We weren't even asking them to help pay for it or anything. My girlfriend can drive herself or Uber to the airport, I would have bought her plane ticket myself, but neither of us want to give her parents more reasons to be pissy with me, so we didn't push for it after they decided they were against it.

The last things I want are for them to have actual reasons to dislike me instead of the bullshit reasons they're coming up with, and I also don't want her relationship with them to be strained because of me, at least not while she's living with them.

I'm just so frustrated with them. I know I'm bitching about her mom in particular here, but both of them claim to not understand long distance.

Run into a random shiny encounter in a Pokemon game? I have the most bland, casual response to it ever. 

Getting a new game I've been waiting for? Nothing, I just get it and play it.

The whole disability thing? Honestly I felt more despressed/anxious even though my aunt, grandparents, and therapist tell me how exciting that it should be.

It's hard to really enjoy the things I used to love, I just feel so empty and soulless. Video games, videos, and streaming servives help distract from a lot of it, but only in the exact moment I'm doing so. As soon as I stop distracting myself, it's back to the emptiness and faking my emotions around other people. 

But I'm even losing my ability to fake and mask my emotions anymore. I'm just so tired of everything. 

From my past I've had:

-My mom's ex bf who was a big, burly, bully and used to pick on me the most throughout most of my childhood.

-My dad's ex gf who was unstable, unpredictable, and honestly kinda crazy. (She once smacked me right on the back of the thigh for accidentally spilling cool-aid on the rug with my foot while I was laying on my bed, leaving a hand-shaped welt on me, as well as other incidents)

-A snobby half sister who was/is the golden child of both my mom, and the big, burly, bully (A.K.A her father) above. Gets to have everything she wants and gets away with everything. 

-My dad who I barely get to see due to living in Alaska, while my mom, sister, half sister, and myself moved to Virginia when I was 10. Was a little too eager to talk about how horrible our mom was when he was in a relationship with her to us.

-An emotionally abusive, manipulating, gaslighting mom who basically trapped me back down in Virgina after a year of me living in Alaska, promising to buy me a plane ticket back to Alaska when I was ready, only to back out of that promise when I did ask. Leaving me trapped here to this very day. 

Presently I still do live with my mom, where she has basically conditioned me not to show any of my negative emotions around her. Instead of trying to be understanding of my depression, Asperger's Syndrome, and ADHD that she KNOWS I have, she gets very critical when I'm unable to hide my depression or emptional numbness and even says things like ""Are you gonna be like that ALL DAY?"" or ""You should SEE the face you're making right now blah blah blah"" ""Why do you look like that?"". When I try to explain to her what I'm feeling and tell her she doesn't know what it's like, she says she DOES know what it's like, claiming that she basically knows all that I go through, etc, when it's clear by her tone and behavior that she doesn't. 

She's never once ever tried to admit any of her own wrongdoings, but she instead likes to flip all the blame onto me for ""not seeking help"" or listening to all her bs ""advice"". In all my years of knowing her, I've never once heard her say ""I'm sorry"" or admit to anything she did wrong. Meanwhile all the little incidents of her causing anxiety attacks right in front of her get swept right under the rug like they never happened. 

So yeah, I'm basically at the end of my rope when it comes to her. My mom wants to blame everyone else but herself for my own misery that she's causing. She even blames my therapist for ""not making me better"". 
I've heard that line so much from her saying how she doesn't like my therapist, so eventually I snapped and yelled at her saying ""YOU'RE not making me better!!"",
but it's the same song and dance of her flipping it over on me, even though I told her what my problem was right then. 

How can I possibly get any better when I'm around my manipulative, hypocritical, gaslighting mom all the time? I've even lost my ability to look forward to things and be excited for something even when somebody says I should be. I can't feel that heart fluttering feeling anymore. Idk what is wrong with me.

2731,"Dissociated and missing being excited about things  Good Morning Fellow Redditors,  
  
For a long time now (at least 4 years), I have just genuinely lost my excitement for life. I remember being so excited for new experiences, events, and exploration in my earlier years up until the age of about 26 (now 30). Nowadays, things couldn't be further from the truth.  
  
Outside of a few things, nothing excites me enough for me to actually do/try it. My weekdays are extremely mundane and routine: work steady hours, have a steady diet and gym routine, nothing unpredictable really happens and I get through my week. I don't particularly care about my current job. I can do what I need to do pretty well and don't have to try too hard. Some would say this sounds like a dream position, but I also spend 20 minutes sitting in my car every morning trying to muster up the strength to start the day.  
  
When it comes to the weekend, when I finally have the freedom to do just about anything I want, there's nothing that provides a strong enough feeling to make me actually do it. Yes, I have forced myself to do many things (hiking, going for a drive, trying new coffee shops, seeing friends), but nothing provides much excitement. I will do the hike, see the friends, etc., and then feel like ""eh, that was fine.""  
  
These things, along with the more common things I do on the weekend (clean, see my parents, run errands that are not really that important) are all just ways to eat up my day, that's it. All I'm ever doing is trying to just fill my day with tasks so the day can be over.  
  
So what are those ""few things"" that provide some sort of excitement/genuine feeling? Well, the most common ones are eating and drinking alcohol. I look forward to just eating something and I look forward to drinking on the weekends (which is usually me drinking alone or going out to a bar with my SO). Alcohol and food just take me away from things for a little.  
  
I don't know what to do. I'm at the point where my life feels completely pointless. I work, basically run menial tasks, and do nothing exciting. I've struggled with dissociation for years (stemming from childhood) but I used to still feel some emotions and have some excitement. Now it's either that I'm numb, angry, or sad.  
  
I want to be excited about things again. I want to WANT to do things, try new experiences, etc., but no matter how much I force myself to, nothing ever seems to work. Has anyone felt the same? And if so, how do you manage it? I'm also open to any ideas from anyone on what I should try exploring because I'm kind of out of ideas at this point.  
  
\*For additional context, I have a few things that I'm genuinely interested in, but I have no idea how to work them into my life in a meaningful way: I love Japanese culture, I love tattoos (I draw and paint, but this doesn't always feel my void), and I love animals (mainly certain animals like foxes, raccoon dogs, different cat species, and other predators).

One of my greatest inner struggles as I've aged ( mid 30s) is the gradual decrease in the wonder, hope, and excitement I've felt . That and what seems like rapidly decreasing memory and mental agility, which I'll keep for a question on another day.

I have been diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder and am currently taking 150 mg bupropin xl and was formerly also taking 10 mg escitalopram ( but I was sleeping a lot more than I wanted). So I know that some of my experience is from the depression and might also be a side effect of the medication.

I also know that a common piece of advice is to try novel experiences. But, I don't have much time (work in academia) or opportunity ( live in a small town far from many places) for this. And when I do try things like going to concerts or on hikes, which used to make me feel some amount of excitement or wonder, I still don't feel much of anything other than looking forward to it being done ( even if I want to be there).

Does any one have advice? I really miss how strongly I felt wonder and hope in particular. Now it seems like I just shuffle through life with not much to look forward to or get excited about ( even career goals seem dull and projects at home just seem like too much work).

2737,"I don‚Äôt feel excitement and it‚Äôs isolating. Suggestions?  I don‚Äôt remember the last time I actually felt exhilarated to do something. Maybe 3 years back when I met my partner, and maybe small bouts when people compliment me but never about things I need to begin but never enough to last. 
My nervousness always takes over - be it for starting college, giving a speech or even going out with friends or even meeting one after a while.

Im a 21F and I‚Äôve just finished my bachelors from one of the top schools in my country and will be starting my job at a consulting firm soon. I should be excited but I‚Äôm dreading it. The thought of meeting new people and making an impression gives me so much anxiety. Staying in I am never able to take things up for more than a week and always get depressed. 

People scare me somehow. I always end up with social anxiety and an inferiority complex. My friends say I isolate myself but I hardly ever am able to relate to people.

I am currently speaking with a counselor/therapist, services offered with my tution and figured I use it. We have been meeting on zoom for three weeks now, 3 visits. Havent touched to much on my deep rooted issues so only surface level stuff.

This is what my post is about... I have the problem where on random occasions I get a rush of adrenaline or dopamine, and that makes me say or do something I shouldn't have said or done. Thankfully the actions I take arent at all physical to another person. Its more about me being impulsive on say buying an item or ignoring a responsibility. But when it comes to using words I shouldn't have said its a problem. For example im in a groupchat with 7 others. Im not to active but I at least once a day say Good Morning and peace out. But on those moments when I get this rush to say what's on my mind or vent, I do so in a very noticeable hating way or through backhanded comments. Some of my friends have picked up on this because one of them told me how they can tell when im in a ""mood"" when I begin talking about a random topic or using particular words. So apparently I am much more grammatically correct when I begin my vent so thats a thing haha. 

Anyways is this something one of you can relate too? When you begin to blurt out emotions or whats been on your mind at random times?",Relaxed

2749,"I can't get excited for anything  I'm currently on vacation, me and my parents will be flying all the way to Singapore.

I was very excited to first hear about this trip, or a trip overseas in general. It's such an amazing vacation spot, to see how people live there, witness their culture and history, live for even a little in a very interesting place

And I just, can't be excited about it. 
I hate that so much.

It's been like this ever since my ex left. I just can't seem to be excited for anything anymore.
My whole summer vacation has been like this. 

It's probably because she used to be the main and sometimes only thing that would keep me going through hard times, the only occasion I would ever look forward to would be seeing her.

I don't think the fact that her birthday will be coming up in a few days, and I'll have to try my hardest not to break no contact, and not to check any social media just in fear that any mutual friend will post anything related to her birthday, helps the situation. 

And now that she's gone, everything, even something as wonderful as going to a whole other country to a whole other continent, just doesn't seem to bring any joy and excitement to me anymore.

It makes living so exhausting if I'm being honest. 
It's just seems like I'm going through the motions, like I'm surviving day after day, while having thoughts and wondering if it's even worth it in the end.

I've heard people try and tell me to set new goals, pick up new hobbies, do all these things which I would love to, but I've genuinely feel like that would either be undermining how important she was to me, or just impossible to get invested in.

Because what is living if there's nothing to look forward to?",Relaxed

I‚Äôm never looking forward to getting physically hurt, but I want to experience as many emotions and states of mind as possible just because I‚Äôm curious how it would feel. For example I was looking up side effects to lexapro and for some reason I‚Äôm excited to go through the bad parts of it? It‚Äôs weird and I‚Äôve always had this.

Lately I noticed that I can't keep conversation. There's one (of many I suppose) reasons and it's *loss of excitement*. What is it?

Whenever I find something cool, interesting and then tell it to someone I lose all enthusiasm. 

E.g. I think learning Spanish in Duo is cool, but after saying it to someone I don't want to learn it anymore. And it happens to everything. It's f***ing exhausting. I think that's one of the reasons why I can't talk to people and make friends.

Long story short I had kind of a date with someone amazing and I'm really looking forward to meeting again.

Problem is, it excites me SO much, that I cannot relax or get it out of my mind for even one minute. Even when I play a game or watch a video, its still in my active mind. It also makes falling asleep very hard for me. I'm overexcited.

I dont know if this has anything to do with my depression but i've been feeling empty and useless for years now and this new experience it feels like i just got hit by INFINITE dopamine at once. I'm so excited i can't handle it. Every second of my day I'm thinking about meeting this person again...

I find myself yearning for my early twenties. For adventure, for unknowing, for risk. I daydream about days when I had no money, no ties. I'm under no illusion that those times were perfect because like I say I was broke, I was often clueless in blissful naivety but it was exciting.

2761,"i have no intrinsic motivation for anything, i feel no excitement for anything anymore  hi guys

i'll be honest i only created a reddit just so i can vent LMAO, so here i go. i'm not the best at talking about my feelings so im sorry if this doesn't make sense.

i've been feeling like a robot for the past three or four years of my life (i'm currently 17) and have never really understood why because, growing up with brown immigrant parents i was never taught to express emotions. so this whole time i've kind of just been internalizing/suppressing everything down and pretending that my life is fine.

however i had a huge breakdown over my thanksgiving break last week because I came to an epiphany that I just simply don't have the intrinsic motivation to do anything. everything feels so forced to me. the reason this bothers me so much is that i feel guilty that i don't feel excited and at ease when i talk to my friends anymore. i am naturally an introvert so i don't expect myself to be super energetic, but nowadays i feel like talking to ANYONE for that matter, even my bestfriend of 7 years, feels so tasking. i have the urge to just isolate and ghost many people but i fight it everyday and it's getting very exhausting. i wish i had interest in other people again, but how do i do that when i don't have any interests myself?

if everything feels so forced, how do i make myself feel happiness or excitement again? i used to love learning about other people. it's not just the social aspect, it's everything around me. i kind of just get up everyday, go to school and fake wanting to talk to my friends, come back, sluggishly do my homework, and then repeat the cycle over and over again. nothing feels gratifying anymore. 

i've thought about it and i feel like the reason i might feel like this is b/c i lack seeing purpose in anything. i don't feel suicidal but it just seems like since nothing brings me joy anymore that there is no purpose in anything. i can't even see myself living past 25 honestly, which is really sad. but what is the point in life if everything just goes downhill from here?

another thing that really scares me is the fact that i have become so comfortable in this state that i'm in. i have to push myself to write this post because i know if i don't, i won't ask anyone for help. i just feel very comfortable and familiar with feeling like this, and trying to become a happier and more content person just seems SO exhausting to me. i just can't wrap my head around the concept of feeling excited. the only motivation i think i really have is extrinsic motivation. the only reason i do well in school rn is that i know if i don't my parents will kill me. other than school, i just don't have an outlet for something i truly enjoy doing. 

i go to school and talk to my friends and i envy them because i know they have so much going on in their personal life, yet they still find the space inside their head to see the excitement in little things or find something that brings them joy. wheras, nothing has brought me joy yet. i don't know what to do in order to fix this.

About a year after my mom died me and my dad moved back to the US where I started at a new school(we lived in germany prior), Over the last few years I had become addicted to playing competitive overwatch and my entire being was dependent on my progress and performance within the game. I had always been a student with good grades except for the roughest times with my mom when I truly could not focus on anything and took a 2 month break from school. When I moved back to the US I could not detatch from playing competitive overwatch it had consumed my life as the only coping mechanism I had, I would spend 90-100 hours every week on top of being a high school student in a college prep program. I rarely did anything with friends and was a husk of a person and due to my time spent on overwatch I nearly failed a class for the first time in my life. Over time I gradually was able to seperate myself from the game and be a healthier person, In march of last year I quit playing the game competitvely and had my first ever serious relationship which lasted up until last month. My grades shot back up after quitting overwatch from a 3.2 gpa to a 3.9 (per semester,unweighted) and after 6 ish months I was able to tell some of my best friends and my dad that I was truly proud of myself and how far I had come.

Everything was so new, thrilling, and exciting then. I was so curious about the world and experiences, and savored every moment of living in the present.

I graduated in December and have been living alone and working full time all year. Nothing seems new and exciting anymore. I just feel like getting through the day. Social events don‚Äôt feel exciting anymore. Dating is starting to feel like a chore. Participating in my hobbies is the only way I can feel like myself but even then it‚Äôs not so fun anymore.

Over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve began to notice that I am starting to feel an exciting anticipation again‚Äîthe first time in years that has happened‚Äî instead of anxiety and dread.

I also find myself writing and creating more which is something I hadn‚Äôt done consistently since 2018-2019!

I‚Äôm not saying every day is perfect, but it‚Äôs getting better!! I really feel hopeful!

If you‚Äôre going through something right now, I just want to encourage you to stick through it. I know it‚Äôs easy to give up and it seems better if you give up, but babe, I promise it‚Äôll be worth it!!

Just keep waking up. We NEED you!!",Relaxed
2774,"I feel like i have lost my excitement, and my mood is always just low. Anxiety is returning, will i feel this way forever?  Ok so around the start of summer, I started smoking weed a bit with my friends, i was on prozac for anxiety, as in previous years i suffered from some serious bouts of health anxiety, though i was much younger. I took something around 30mg. I was starting to worry about interference with the prozac and weed, so I decided to stop taking the medication cold turkey, so right then i stopped taking it. I continued to smoke weed wit my friends over summer, sometimes doing it every day for a week and even multiple weeks straight. I didnt notice a change in how i felt that much (from what i remember) until later on, when i noticed i started to feel off. I felt like my mood was off, and i was finding it hard to enjoy things, and to find things fun. I just ignored it and thought maybe it was just from me maturing, but towards the end of summer, and now with school starting back up. My mood feels off still, i am finding it hard to find things interesting, i am finding it hard to be able to relax, and to feel comfortable. Like there is always something bothering me it feels like sometimes, and i just feel like i am dull, and that i dont feel happy. And im so scared. I am only 15, i dont want to feel like this forever. Sometimes i get overwhelmed with how different i feel now, and i just get scared because i dont want to have done something to my brain that might be permanent, it feels like my anxiety is just preventing me from things, i had a facetime call with a therapist i had back when i had bad health anxiery, and they even suggested a medical exam to see if maybe i am low in iron which is affecting my mood. And no im scared about that because i dont know if something is maybe causing low iron, like a medical problem. I dont really have any physical symptoms except one small bump on the back of my neck it doesnt really feel like a lymph node, it feels like a kinda under skin pimple that doesnt pop but not a lymph node, not painful, and it is moveable. But no other symptoms. i have bad anxiety about my looks, i hate the way i look but i never really cared much about it before and it just started to come on. And it just bothers me i have anxiety about all these things i just want to relax, did getting off my meds or smoking weed do something to my brain chemicals to cause this? did one or the other? did the combo of both? And did getting off my medication cause this and it is just catching up kinda recently? or is this from weed? i may have noticed that after smoking weed i felt the emptyness but i dont know if smoking impacted it or if it was just me overall feeling like that, as i did feel that way often and still do. Someone please help me im scared i cant sleep well i dont want to go to school i feel terrible, i feel like im not myself.",Relaxed

Nonetheless she prescribed me Lexapro, but didn't even give a diagnosis. My therapist, on the other hand, listens to me carefully and seems getting worried. Today, after pointing out that my mood is never constant and that when I see her I seem either very optimistic and excited or very depressed and pessimistic, she asked me if I often experience such mood changes and if, when I'm in my good mood, i feel very excited, confident, able to do anything etc. Her question worried me, because I've never payed attention to my mood swings and, most importantly, because she rarely asks such questions, preferring listening to me.

Before this whole lockdown, I couldn't really find a place where I fit in. I feel like an alien wherever I am. Work, friends, family. Everywhere. I don't feel like I belong. I've tried several times to reach out to various sources. 

Friends - in hopes that board games or social times would cheer me up.

Family - Just to talk or visit

Internet - Such as here, to vent and hope that I'm not alone.

Even now, I'm at work trying to keep my shit together, just to look normal. I know this whole covid thing has made the whole feeling like I'm on an island much worse, but I sometimes feel like I'm a step beyond that. Right now, I feel like I'm drowning, and no one cares to save me. My wife tries her damndest, and most days, does a good job. But sometimes, my brain is just better at keeping me down.

I'm a 22 year old female, just finished college and started full time work in June so I'm in this job just around 2 months. I have always been a very positive person up until the last few weeks. Any excitement I had for life is gone, I feel a bit 'what's the point' about everything. Every day is the same. Every week is the same. And I find myself going deeper and deeper into this negative mindset to the point where I find myself crying on a daily basis and everything has become an effort to me and this worries me as I have never experienced this before. I have no hobbies really, where I live is a small rural town where there's not much to do. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get excited about the smaller things in life again? And any advice on how to undo a negative mind set and maintain a positive one? Also any advice on hobbies too would be great.

Instead of giving the tired little old me a decision. They are threatening me. (A threat doesn't have to be physical or even mental) first they physically threatened me by telling me they were gonna come in with a wooden spoon. Then my sister asked me if I was retarded because I wasn't coming out. Then they told me I would have more chores to do stacking wood by myself. (Typically a tier or two but I usually do it with my sister). Then they told me to leave because I wasn't excited or happy in the least. My mother made fun of my voice because it isn't amazingly cheerful or excited in the slightest. Then everyone told me to leave because I was ruining the mood and now I feel wonderful about being tired and bored. So now I feel like shit (I didn't read the rules I just figured this was a mental issue support website) and I honestly think about suicide all the time.

But when i think,it just feels blank(sometimes) like i can tell whether it was good or bad but i Don't get that particular feeling about something. 

While reading/watching something,if i went to the dinner table to have a meal. When i return in 15-20 minutes it's like i feel anything which i felt while reading it,even the sense of enjoyment vanishes. While I can tell that i was enjoying it just a while ago i wouldn't anymore.

If I get excited (I don't get a lot excited,so the bar level is pretty down) after finishing a particular chapter or episode of a series,the entire sensation of being excited about it dries down in about an hour. 
You might be excited for something for a fair period of time,but I don't,i like to discuss about series in different forms of entertainment but i have nearly stopped it as i get no certain excitement for more than a few hours.

I wasn't like this, although i collected my emotions,i would remain excited for something for a long period of time. I have had my fair share of painful experiences in life, I'm barely 18 and it already feels like i am adult who has almost forgotten what enjoyment feels like.

When I'm very excited or very happy, my whole body reacts to it. I have to jump around and I hit my wrists and hit furniture around me, hit my head or stuff like that because it feels like I need to release this overwhelming emotion. I can stop myself with some willpower and sit down again but then the wrist hitting continues or I have to distract myself with something that could take my head away from what caused this happiness. I can't really calm myself down otherwise and this behavior led to me avoiding things that make me this excited if I have the choice, since it's really taxing on my body. This makes me kinda sad tho, because I don't want to avoid the things that make me most excited and happy.  
Some time ago my best friend managed to get me this excited and I didn't know what to do because I felt really ashamed that I react that way when I'm overwhelmingly happy. I shared with her that that's why I avoid things that make me too happy and she suggested I should ask a therapist, because it doesn't sound good that it feels so uncomfortable for me to be happy.

Just writing about it makes me feel so ashamed and sad.

2789,"I only ever get things done as an act of desperation or when it gives me pure excitement. There is no in between.  I had a small epiphany today in regards to my mental state and my life-long problem with following through with my plans.
I realized that everything that I ever actually get done is done only out of desperation (like moving or going for a better job when the previous environment/job becomes unbearable) or because it causes pure excitement. There is no in between.

For some reason the thought of a lot of things that I plan to do everyday or generally in life does not excite me enough. It's natural that not everything will bring pure excitement and some tasks will be more meticulous and less exciting than others and there might be some hard ones to go through before you get to the exciting part, but that is already stopping me from even starting or trying. It's not that I think of it that way, I just realized that subconsciously this must be the problem for me. Because I really really want to accomplish some of these plans that I make for myself, but I can never seem to even start working on them. Or I'll start by guilting myself into it and then stop after a few days and not touch the task again for the next couple months.

And then there are also some tasks and chores that simply need to get done, which are emotionally neutral, so I can't live on like that, ignoring them until they become a must to do out of desperation of how many dirty dishes are cluttering the kitchen for example.

My tries of guilting myself into doing things don't work well for obvious reasons - sometimes it'll get me to do something that I've planned for a while but it never lasts and the whole process just makes me hate myself more and I end up feeling like shit. 

I wish I could understand what is causing this. It goes for literally everything in my life from easy chores through working out to learning a foreign language or wanting to change a job. I want to move to a different city (I have specific one in mind that I genuinely love) and I am ridiculously underpaid for the job I do yet I can't seem to do anything to change my current situation. Only typing out my updated resume took me 1.5 years of hyping myself up to finally finish... It'll probably take 2 more years before I start sending it out to new job applications at this pace.

2791,"Extreme excitement after certain activities, very debilitating.  Hello everyone,

I've been dealing with mental health issues since I was a teenager. Had depression for the first time when 14yo and for the last four years I've battled depression. Had a really rough time, last year I spent a whole month on the bed, started taking meds, became agressive with it...

To make the story shorter, after some aggressive episodes, a couple of different doctors diagnosed me with 'a very light kind of bipolar disorder with a mood disorder element' (in those exact words - he says my 'high' episodes are too short to me to be considered bipolar). The thing is, around one year ago I started playing basketball again and lifting weights and for some reason, I started getting really excited, agitated for a whole day after doing it. Heart pumping really hart, my mind working really fast, constant movement of feet and hands and a difficulty to sleep. A few weeks ago I started studying to apply for a new job, and after those studying sessions I also feel REALLY agitated. And it is something I can't just lay on my bed and relax to stop. I've tried breathing exercises, music, and both didnt work at all, actually made me really annoyed. Sometime eating a shitload of food (to the point I feel heavy and bloated) helps, but then again that isn't healthy at all. 

Is this some sort of thing from my 'bipolarity'? Is it something else you guys can suggest me looking ? 

btw, I stopped going for the doctor 6mo ago. Got out of money and can't come back right now. ",Relaxed

This may just be because of me reflecting of my one-sided romantic interests or just my general understanding that my interests and lifestyle inherently make me predisposed to sit alone in public or being quiet in a large group of people.

My problem is that I can never seem to define what I enjoy doing, and what I think is important and meaningful. It's honestly as if I'm totally blind to it. So here‚Äôs a story:

**I‚Äôm sitting on a big ship.**. The ship is in fact my own, but instead of getting behind the ship's wheel I just let the wind choose the direction. Sometimes, when the ocean is calm, the boat just lays there swinging lightly back and forth in a slight breeze, while I sit with my phone or a book on deck. If Im unlucky, the weather blows up to a storm. But instead of taking charge of the situation I just go and hide below deck to avoid the turmoil. I'd rather just sleep. 

During the best periods on the boat, I have friends, family, workmates to hang out with. That's fun. That's when I feel like things are starting to happen. _I let my friends take the ship's wheel and steer it wherever they want to,_ and I enjoy the purpose and meaning it brings. Sometimes we're going to a reef to see cool sea creatures, sometimes we're trying to save the marine life together, and sometimes we're on a long trip to a destination on the other side of the world. The point is, we're _doing_ something together. I love that.  


**But I never steer the boat myself.**


It's not necessarily that I don't know how to. It's more like I lack reason. Nothing sounds fun enough, meaningful, or even worth the hassle. However with people I feel better because I feel like I belong. Plus, others usually come up with fun destinations and water activities to do, so I don‚Äôt have to face my inner laziness. 

**The price I‚Äôm paying is that other‚Äôs wishes and our group activities are just a substitute for the lack of meaning I feel within myself.**

Don't get me wrong, I'm not completely at the bottom of the ocean. Last year I became super passionate about the thought of writing, but I've found out I wouldn't have the stamina to fight against the waves of the ocean to reach that end goal. It's not worth it. So now I'm thinking of taking up horse riding again - but there is this little thoguht nagging inside of me that _‚ÄùIt's not meaningful enough. You need something that you're deeply passionate about, something to aim for every day, something that makes you want to go up in the mornings!""_

I've felt like this for years and years, but I can‚Äôt think of something I find meaningful. My life is not stimulating. My job is well-paid and quite okay. But my life in general is not fulfulling. It's not exciting. And it eats me from the inside out.

My life could definitely be much worse - I'm employed, own a home, I've got enough money to support myself. 

But I feel like I'm just going through the motions each day. I get up, I shower, I work in a job that stresses me out and I don't feel enables me to use the skills I have, I eat dinner, watch TV, browse the internet aimlessly, go to sleep.

My weekends seem to be consumed by all the tedious tasks that come with being a grown up - grocery shopping, life admin, cleaning, laundry.

I'm jealous of people 10 or 15 years younger than me and I keep getting lost in feelings of nostalgia and regret over my 20's being behind me and it all being downhill from here. I miss having energy and enthusiasm and the freedom to be spontaneous.

My partner likes the idea of moving to a bigger house and embracing a fairly ordinary sort of life but all those things feel like a chore to me - moving is a pain and comes with extra costs and responsibilities and the other trappings of a normal life just feel tedious.

I don't have any kids and neither me nor my partner want them, but that seems to be the default goal for people my age. I don't know what the rest of my life is supposed to be about. My career doesn't give me a sense of purpose or achievement - it's just a way to make a living, and not one I particularly enjoy or feel motivated about. If your life isn't about your career or having a family, then what is it about? Especially when the amount of free time you have seems to get smaller and smaller as you get older.

I've recently started taking medication for depression (again - I took anti-depressants for a year or so in my late 20's) and I'm hoping that will help. My concern is that the medication won't get to the heart of what's making me feel this way though - SSRIs can't give me a sense of purpose in life.

I want to be able to see something ahead to convince me that the best isn't already behind me. Because if it is, then what's the point?",Relaxed

I have diagnosed ADHD with comorbid depression and anxiety. That‚Äôs all been sorted out and understood almost. Im on antidepressants and ADHD meds that work great.

But even with this help, I have periods of time, maybe 4-5 days every couple of weeks where I just, cannot do anything. It feels like just, a punch of anxiety and some depression. I can‚Äôt talk to anyone, I can‚Äôt do any responsibilities, I give up on things immediately, I‚Äôm in a lot of pain, super tense muscles, all of that. But as quick as it comes on, it‚Äôs gone. But they‚Äôre so bad, that they restrict me from doing absolutely anything until it passes. By the time it does, I‚Äôm behind in like, everything. I get super stressed until I‚Äôve tackled everything I needed to but I also just feel so insanely guilty about everything. They‚Äôre not nearly as long or as bad as they used to be before my antidepressants. I try to figure out what causes them, but I just can‚Äôt. 

I also have random periods of, maybe also 4-5 days where I feel absolutely elated. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs mania, I‚Äôm not doing anything distressing or in need of hospitalization (though I do impulse buy a lot), but I feel this bubbly feeling in my chest like I wanna shout or cry or kiss someone or throw a party. My libido goes up, I‚Äôm getting so many idea creatively, I‚Äôm sociable, etc. I feel like conquering the world, I‚Äôm super super chatty, I get entertained by everything, I have laser focus, I‚Äôm hyper productive, all of that stuff. Like idek if it‚Äôs normal excitement, but again, I‚Äôd be sitting there trying to figure out why I‚Äôm so insanely happy. I‚Äôve never been on ecstasy but I‚Äôd imagine I get the idea good enough. They don‚Äôt even happen like, after I take my meds or anything, they just come on at random. 

Sometimes these switches happen all in the same day too. I‚Äôll be doing the exact same thing under the same circumstances as I was when I was feeling elated like the next day, and I just can‚Äôt do it bc I feel so nauseous and depressed and exhausted. 

A lot of my friends with ADHD can‚Äôt relate to my extent, I have NO clue what it is. It‚Äôs so distressing to try and be looking for a pattern or a reason for these switches and finding nothing at all. I can‚Äôt be bipolar, the switches don‚Äôt last long and aren‚Äôt like, as extreme as I know some people with BD get them. Is this normal? Am I just worried about nothing?",Relaxed
2816,"New challenge ahead. Finally getting treatment after almost 15years of waiting. I‚Äôm excited!  I‚Äôve been very lucky. Only within two weeks I got a place at the mental hospital where I will finally be able to search for my diagnosis for all my life troubles. I had to manifest this deeply and with a little help from my new guardian angel I am starting my recovery tomorrow already. 

Ever since I remember I‚Äôve struggled with my attention deficit, depression, burn out, grieve, self harming symptoms and suicidal thoughts. I am a highly sensitive person and always have been, as a child I‚Äôve always been told to be ‚Äòway too sensitive‚Äô and ‚Äòway to caught up in my own imaginary world‚Äô. I struggled with an selective eating disorder along the way and never got rid of it. After many years of drug abuse for self therapy and many visits at the docs I am finally getting the help I‚Äôve always asked for. I‚Äôm so overwhelmed. I‚Äôm trying not to have my expectations too high, but after all I‚Äôm almost 30 years old now and know that they won‚Äôt magically turn my struggles into ‚Äònormality‚Äô. I just want to know where I‚Äôm coming from so I can finally treat myself with the respect and love I have for so many others ü•π‚ô•Ô∏è

I just felt like I want to share this with someone/you. I never thought that one day I will let myself receive the help I always deserved and that people will actually start to listen to me. I‚Äôm amazing in compensating and always will be. It‚Äôs not fair they did not listen when I was little‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm actually happy I can now decide this for myself with a much more mature mind. It‚Äôs not too late to take my life in my hands and change for the better even if there will be more challenges along the way. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my little story. I will come back and let you know how it went and if this was a good idea after all. By the way I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs ADHD, BPD and AFRID. Hopefully I will know after the next three weeks. 

If you‚Äôve been at a hospital let me know your most important things you think I should need to know. I‚Äôve packed my suitcase with an old school mp3 player, a cuddly toy for mental support, great lectures to read and even a mandala book to calm down and paint (never thought I would buy one of these haha).

But yesterday I just wanted it to be over so I could go lay back down. I tried to sign up for online therapy. I live in a small town and there's not a therapist plus my car broke down and I have my 3yo and 2yo all the time and it's hard to get a sitter. When I tried online therapy 2 of the places I tried basically said they couldn't help me and I needed to do in person therapy. Out of all things that made me laugh though.

I was a bit shocked because I was sure I wanted to do more things.

I used to be bullied for being and underachiever when i was younger and i feel horrible if i don't do enough every day. I feel like i'm going to be like i used to. Lazy. I feel like i will become a useless, unworthy person.

2849,"I'm not excited to see my friends anymore  I got diagnosed with severe depression a while back and was pretty unwilling to do anything. I spent most of my time kinda just keeping to myself. Tired all the time and unable to get the thought of being dead out of my head. I've gotten a lot better since then, after attending sessions with my therapist and GP I no longer have those constant suicidal thoughts and whilst I'm not constantly sad I feel just kinda empty (which is a lot better than soul crushing sadness). 

But one thing I've noticed since then is I prefer being alone and doing my own thing. I like going for walks at night when there are less people and I can just kinda enjoy being out in the open by myself. I'm on holidays currently for a month and haven't seen my friends since I left but as I'm reaching the end of my holiday I don't feel as excited about seeing them as I did before I left. 

I still love them but I just don't feel great about seeing them. It's almost like I feel as if I'm not ready to see them for some reason. I feel like there's some sort of emotional barrier stopping me from letting myself be excited to see their faces again. 

I was pretty anxious about all my friends viewing me as a burden for the past three years and only recently stopped feeling that way so maybe this is linked to that? 

I'm not exactly sure what I want from this post either. I partially want to see if this is a normal feeling but at the same time I just want to get it off my chest since I can't really talk to anyone about it right now.",Relaxed

I am so lucky that it's received so much positive feedback and recently someone named Rod Cate, who is an author of the book ""Get Back Up"" approached me to share my story on his podcast. I was SO nervous about the episode airing because I dive deeper into the aspects of my personal life and I mention my family who are so near and dear to my heart. They are not completely comfortable with the fact I am sharing so much personal information about my family, so I have been trying to balance respecting them but also sharing the story of ""me"" that feels important for me to tell.

The episode came out absolutely beautiful. I was nervous that I would sound unintelligent and stumble over words but the producer did an amazing job cleaning it up. The episode is only 22 minutes long, but it does a great job capturing who I am as a person and the purpose of what I am doing.

I think that after the excitement died down I stopped seeing him out of the corner of my eye, until tonight, when I 'saw' him in the hall, exiting my room.

It's not unusual for him to wake up from a nap when he hears me leave, but I first I knew that I probably didn't actually see him, but the door was slightly ajar so I looked for him anyway. Lo and behold, he was in the same spot he was a few hours ago: napping away in my room.

When I was a kid a drawn a lot. At the primary school, around 6-7 years old, I started to draw violent black and white pictures with red blood. I drawn sceneries with stick figures hurting each other with a lot of blood. Drawing this kind of stuff gave me erections.
I drew a lot of violent things until around 14-15 years old but it wasn't exciting me at this age from what I remember.

I remember when I was playing Midtown Madness 2 in free mode (you know, without goal, you just drive through the city), I also had erections.

Years later I came across this subject by chance with a good friend ; he told me he had erections while playing GTA.

I didn't searched on the internet about this but I don't know if this is normal or not and what causes these situations to be exciting.

My friend told me ""yeah I've had these erections, but that's not about sex : the game is damn good, it's just‚Ä¶  You're just hard !""

I don't draw anymore and I don't have this kind of erection anymore too. I do felt a bit of shivers in my groin area when I played GTA V. It's the freedom, the moral and physical transgression you experience in this kind of gameplay. Even in Midtown Madness 2.

I had a relationship with a girlfriend for about 6 years. I noticed that when she was angry at me or sad (supposedly) because of me, this did causes me to have erections and beeing sexually excited.

2888,"Something I recently became aware of.  Hey there, I am a 19 y.o. guy and recently I started paying attention to a certain thing of mine that I have daily. Basically I often get something that I can only describe as ‚Äúgetting winded up‚Äù for practically no reason at all. I can just sit and do nothing when suddenly I get all excited (euphoric even), or, on the contrary, extremely sad, borderline depressed or very anxious. I‚Äôve had this for my whole life and, as far as I‚Äôm concerned, nobody I know has this as well. Excitement can be caused by even a little bit of stimuli (like chatting with somebody (online or even irl), listening to music, etc.). On the other hand, if I sit alone with nothing to do I lose every bit of energy I had. When this happens I feel my heartbeat increase, heat in my chest, extreme need to do something right this second, I can start hyperventilating as well. I also get these random bursts of energy every once in a while that can kickstart such state of mine. It appears randomly any time and causes an extreme rush of energy all of a sudden that I shake off. Literally, my whole body just shakes for a second or two. This whole state of excitement is very unstable and can be easily converted into negativity without much struggle.

  
One time I was chatting with a friend of mine online, while being in this state, and she thought I was drunk, lol.

  
When I was a little younger I connected this whole thing with puberty and hormones, but as I‚Äôm getting older, it starts to concern me genually. I don‚Äôt connect it with any condition, simply don‚Äôt wanna put lables on myself. Basically I just wanna know wether it‚Äôs normal, or should I get it checked by a professional.

You need to recover enough to believe in your self to some degree when escaping homelessness. It can be a vicious cycle I was lucky that I was only in that place a few months.

Then there's moving to the city, I needed to control my panic attacks and be able to get on a bus without valium. In December 2017 I took my maximum medication dose and still couldn't get on a train. Now I take trains everywhere, I love taking the train. So many things I thought I hated or couldn't do because of my anxiety. I now love these activities because I don't hate myself anymore.

2893,"Excited to try Mindbloom Ketamine Therapy - To anyone who has ever done Mindbloom Psychedelic Therapy: what did you think and/or felt regarding your anxiety/depression?  I am excited to try Mindbloom so that I can have a reality check as I have mild to severe anxiety, depending on school and the job situation. Mindbloom is a 3 month psychedelic therapy treatment program using a very low dose of Ketamine that helps with mental health, specifically anxiety and depression. It‚Äôs very safe. It‚Äôs an anesthetic they use in small doses together with therapy.

It‚Äôs been around since 1970, but has only been used for anxiety and depression therapy for about 20 years.¬† It‚Äôs apparently very effective. It goes together with the therapy to reprogram your brain. They explain in a video that anxiety and/or depression can come from having repetitive negative thoughts and stuff like that. It is all done under medical and therapeutic guidance.¬†

My dad told me about Mindbloom two days ago because he heard about it from a podcast. So I set my initial consult at the end of May, and my first two virtual visits in early to mid June. I will be¬†embarking on a therapeutic experience, designed to help me reconnect with myself and with the world, to become a more whole individual for those I care about.¬†I will be working with experts - clinicians and guides, in structured experiences, to help unlock and unblock parts of myself. I will be doing some work on myself, that I am working in a new therapeutic model, and that I are moving through a psychedelic therapy protocol with a practitioner and a particular compound. It is to augment and assist the existing personal and therapeutic work I am already doing. I had found some supportive science around the experience and wanted to see if it could be beneficial for me. If you have questions or concerns, you can look¬†[at the current science](https://www.mindbloom.com/the-neuroscience-of-ketamine).

Questions from Mindbloom ([https://www.mindbloom.com/blog/psychedelic-therapy-how-to-explain-to-others](https://www.mindbloom.com/blog/psychedelic-therapy-how-to-explain-to-others)¬†):

¬†What is true in your life that makes you interested in embarking on this healing journey?

My anxiety and my realization to become better and become my best self as possible is true in my life that makes me interested in embarking on this healing journey.

What did you experience that was beneficial or significant for you?

Reflecting back in what has happened in this year regarding my work experience, the fact of me getting but losing two jobs in two-three months as well as a confusion in my nutrition career path during that same time period has made me want to handle my anxiety in the correct healthy manner. Losing 2 jobs was not beneficial in the financial sense, but from a healing mental health perspective, I will take the experience as a learning experience and keep moving forward.

I am positive that everything will be ok.¬†

That just immediately sparked a fantasy in my mind about killing someone and putting their body parts in acid to watch it dissolve. I also masturbate to these thoughts as well. It just makes me excited. I have no close friends at all and rarely talk at school. I just don't like to open up to people and spend a lot of time internalizing, fantasizing.

I'm not depressed anymore and actually wake up with energy and excitement now. 

Vitamin D supplements are super cheap and you can even buy them on Amazon. Consider giving it a try. I noticed the change after only 3-4 days already.

But if you take any meds, check in with your doctor or at least Google to ensure it's safe for you to add the vitamin D supplements (there's like three meds that you'd have to be careful with, as far as I know). 

Additionally, if you're vegetarian/vegan or just don't eat a lot of meat, an iron deficiency could also be a reason for your depression. Iron supplements are also on Amazon for little money.

Hope this helps someone out ‚ù§Ô∏è


Edit: 
As this is getting a lot of traction: What this post was about is that my therapist as well as I thought that I had depression. But taking vitamin D solved many problems for me. A vitamin D deficiency can cause many of the symptoms depression does, up to the point of a misdiagnosis. That's why this post exists. Some people may be misdiagnosed, some people may not even have a therapist to diagnose them so they did it themselves and rolled with it. 

This post is a suggestion to consider the possibility and try something new, to raise awareness that something that looks and feels like depression doesn't have to be exactly that. It helped me and I hope that someone out there who's in a similar situation as I am/was can benefit from the experience I had.",Relaxed

I‚Äôve developed a fear of what I love. Because of trauma. Not because of any rational fears. It‚Äôs an association issue. It sets off a trauma response for me now. Everyone knows me to love surfing. It is who I am. I have called myself a surf addict, etc. 

I‚Äôve lost who I am. This thing brought me ultimate joy, peace, excitement and inspiration. And now I have trauma reactions at even the word or seeing surf content online. Even seeing a surf photo gives me automatic panic / trauma responses.

Around 10 months back, some major bad events struck me in a series. Since then I'm struggling on both ends. One week I'm trying to be super goal oriented and trying to kill it while the next week I'm just being in my mind or sleeping. I still have that old ambitious person in me but on the other hand I'm like, let's do it later. This laziness mainly stems from the depressing 10 months. Also I've never been a guy that complains about bad things happening. But since the last 10 months I've given my best to improve my life and as much I give the positive effort, I'm getting the same level of negative events.
This has somewhere killed the ambition and zeal for things inside me. 

So my all of my fuels, ambition, result-driven personality and spontaneity are working in my negative despite my attempts to fix them.

Is it normal that you have some calm phases in life where you just let it pass. Have you ever experienced this ?

When I say calm panic attacks here is what I mean: physically I feel fine and don't react, but my brain feels like it goes into overdrive and starts questioning everything and getting really contemplative and theoretical (i.e. do I really love my friends and girlfriend, why do I exist (contemplative, not suicidal), is what I'm looking at real, what would happen if I screamed right now, I kinda wanna smash something against a wall). It feels like I'm in a different dimension or like I'm on acid (which I've never done but in theory what its supposed to feel like, but only the bad parts). It's an odd feeling where I feel like I'm almost envisioning myself going psychotic and sometimes physically react to that as well (i.e. pulling on my hair, pacing back and forth, biting my nails and shirt, excessively tapping things, rocking back and forth more than the average ""I can't focus"" rocking back and forth, questioning my morals, etc.). Nothing ever triggers these thoughts, I could be in the best mood or worst mood but regardless these thoughts just kinda come out of nowhere. Generally they appear more when I'm tired or hungry, but they do just appear randomly as well no matter what shape my health is in. It's somewhat of a numbing feeling. I'm just curious how people generally get through these episodes? It's heartbreaking to one second love the people around me (even people as close as my girlfriend or brother) but then feel numb to them the next minute because I suddenly go numb. I almost feel guilty sometimes after these episodes because I'm like ""Wow, how could I ever not love this person? They are amazing!!"" Has anyone had similar experiences and has any advice? Generally I get through it with time, deep breaths, and journaling or drawing, but any tips are appreciated!! Thanks :)",Relaxed

2940,"Calming music helps with anxiety (in my case)  Hey all!  
  
  
So, I've been struggling with anxiety for about 10 years now (I'm 27).   
  
It all started when my parents divorced back in 2012.   
At first, I wasn't fully aware of the consequences, but soon after I started losing weight, losing sleep (could go 3-4 nights without any sleep) and even got diagnosed with tachycardia (even though I was always a healthy and athletic kid and was doing sports since 6 years old).   
I even stopped training football and went to many different doctors and medical checks, but the results would always turn out good, even though I haven't felt good.  
  
At 16, I realized that whenever I had those anxiety attacks that kept me awake at nights, I would play my favorite relaxing music which would help me ease my mind and eventually fall asleep.   
I got so into chill and relaxing music (usually instrumentals) that my friends always made fun of me.   
But, that didn't stop me so I decided to give it a try and start producing Lo-Fi music myself.  
Now, 10+ years later, I've decided to start a record label which will focus on helping people with anxiety.   
  
All of the music is carefully crafted with relaxing instruments, melodies and tempo between 60-80 beats per minute, which can cause the brain to synchronize with the beat causing alpha brainwaves.   
These alpha waves are what's present when we're relaxed, calm and conscious.  
If you'd like to be a part of our journey, let's build a community and help people deal with anxiety.  
  
P.S. - I know this may not work for everyone out there, but I'm sure there are a lot of people who'll find this relevant and enjoy this type of stress-relieving music, so if you're one of them, you can find us on Instagram: calmmusicrecords   
We post daily tips and stress-relieving quotes combined with beautiful nature landscapes and mellow aesthetics.   
Also, we upload new music every Friday and focus on covering only the most trending, but fitting songs, so you can be familiar with the beat and melodies.  
  
My journey with stress relieving and anxiety healing started with music, so I hope it helps you too.

One jump in and I had to yell at the operator to stop because I found the feeling of free fall FRIGHTENING. 

I also never enjoyed roller coasters much either cause of the similar feeling but I found that taking deep breaths made everything feel better (it was still uncomfortable but it was better by virtue of it being slightly more manageable) so I‚Äôm able to ride with friends and still find some fun in it. 

The same way, whenever I fly and we hit rough air, I start feeling adrenaline course through my veins, I get white knuckled clinging on to the arm rests as hard as I can, and i fasten my seatbelt as tight as possible. Deep breathing helps a bit but not as much as it does while I‚Äôm on a roller coaster - if anything I should know roller coasters are more likely to get derailed than airplanes getting damaged from turbulence. But I just get so stressed out. Meanwhile FA‚Äôs and other more seasoned travelers don‚Äôt seem to be bothered one bit. And I‚Äôm not talking about a few bumps here and there, I‚Äôm talking about moderate/high turbulence where the tube starts shaking, you get jostled around in your seat, you feel 0 gravity and your butt lifts off the seat for a second, or you feel your organs sink. 

I‚Äôm very much aware that planes are made to withstand turbulence but it Seems that knowledge and practicing mindful deep breathing aren‚Äôt enough to override my body‚Äôs fight or flight reflex when I experience turbulence or free fall. Its weird cause I can do these and get over the fear when riding roller coasters, but never for turbulence. 

Its almost like I have PTSD from the very first time I got on that slingshot trampoline  and I can‚Äôt seem to recover from it no matter how many times I expose myself to the same stimuli (be it roller coasters or flights). I get on around 6-8 flights in a year and probably experience moderate/high turbulence in at least 2 of those flights.

2961,"I want to calm down and become stable  For the last year and a half (really from Jan. 2022) I've had about 4-5 panic attacks that had me gag, feel cold for no reason, lose appetite, severe envy and craving for attention and all that. Most, if not all were related to inter-personal relations with the latest one being explained below.

So I've had a crush on someone that didn't quite work out after I missed their sign, and them ultimately rejecting my later signs. But as luck would have it, I was able to find a date not so much after. But because this relationship started without giving me enough time to clear my mind about my ex-crush, I've always told myself that I felt pretty confident that I moved on and that the ex-crush and I were on good terms. 

But now, as of the last 7 or so days, I am finding myself over-worrying about the way my ex-crush talks with me on messaging apps and whether or not I'm invited to his birthday party in december. Since this also coincided with me feeling nervous and/or anxious about how I'm perceived overall, the latter was what I told my current partner and I am still very grateful for the care and support they have shown me. And I would really like to make sure that the fact that I really adore my partner gets through.

Then again, my partner isn't too big on public display of affection while my love language would be a rather physical one and a constant reaffirmation of romantic attitudes. So there is a clash in that regard since my partner would feel my style of conversation repetitive and often over-bearing, while I am here now craving for like an hour long hugs and all that.

2963,"Calming Racing/Intrusive Thoughts  I‚Äôve been struggling with anxiety and nervousness since I was in about 7th grade. I coped with it throughout high school and college, but once I was in my 20s and working full time I knew I had to get on medication to calm my brain. I‚Äôm 33 now, and feel like I‚Äôm just at a cross roads of figuring out who I am. I‚Äôve been on and off many meds working with my doctors and now currently on Lexapro, Wellbutrin and Buspar. I had been taking Qelbree since being diagnosed with ADHD in the fall of 2022. However I decided to stop the Qelbree as I was just feeling very tired throughout the day, and didn‚Äôt want to feel like I was being over-medicated. 
 
I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm the classic example of ADHD, I.e. not being able to sit in school, hard time listening to the teacher or following rules, etc‚Ä¶.mine is more on the Inattentive side where my reading comprehension was always poor, and was never fully able to digest information people say to me in a conversation. And even to this day when I get asked to do something adhoc from my boss I‚Äôll panic but then want to get it done as fast as possible to get it off my plate. I‚Äôll review it and make sure it‚Äôs accurate but never go above and beyond. 

I am married, and have a nice house but still feel like I‚Äôm not deserving of it, and I would say my self esteem is slightly low. I guess I sort of have the imposture syndrome, especially with starting a new job last year. I feel unmotivated and lazy from time to time. No real depression where I can‚Äôt get out of bed, but the blues from time to time. 

I‚Äôve always had racing thoughts with some OCD (counting, cleanliness) and intrusive thoughts with an addictive personality - watching porn, using nicotine, marijuana use over the years to relieve stress or make me feel euphoric to escape my fears. And then of course my mind recognizes that these things are okay in moderation and I‚Äôd try to quit them forever and then relapse down the road. 

Any tips for coping with intrusive and racing thoughts (like being unable to settle down and relax because you FEEL like you have to get something done whether it be errands, work, chores around the house)? I guess I could try to exercise more but is there any tips or techniques that help to trick your brain into not giving in to those intrusive and unwanted thoughts? 

I know this is a lot but I wanted to explain my entire situation because it‚Äôs been bugging me for a long time, and my therapist hasn‚Äôt really been able to help me besides doing breathing exercises and writing down words of affirmation for myself.

Dear Reddit, as title says when times get really rough, I still resort to thoughts of harming myself - guns and jumping from heights, to calm myself down. At the worst I used to have constant thoughts of harming myself or others, walking through anywhere or doing anything - even if not particularly challenging. For context, I have never self harmed as I don't think it makes sense and it would be a very slippery slope for me. I also present pretty confidently and often feel pretty confident, although imho this is more just not caring about others rather than true confidence.  
  
My situation is I had previously been accepted into a global top 5 university, but messed it up partially due to mental health (eg had really bad anxiety hives and heard voices during exam period). This year, mental health is much improved, but I face the reality of potentially flunking my exams again (finished them 5 days ago and did not preform as wanted), after been rejected from my first choices unis due to admin errors. This would mean going to my 5th choice uni - effective a transition of 5th globally to 500th globally which is pretty hard to bear. + Asian and Academic background and the social stresses this bring.  
  
Again, I know that failure on things are entirely my responsibility and fault.  
  
I thought I was finally becoming a viable person, moving away from about 8ish years of poor mental health, and the past two years of very poor mental health, but apparently not. In Lieu of real therapy (would never be allowed in my household privately and have now left school), please could anyone send me some thoughts so I can move forwards.",Relaxed

2986,"Calming your monkey mind  The mind is easily distracted, our awareness swinging from branch to branch, not settling on anything. This is something I experience daily - I go onto the computer to check an email that I need to reply to but remember something I saw on the news and check Twitter to see if there‚Äôs any update about it. I see something else there on a subject I find interesting and it takes me to Youtube. The monkey swings and jumps around very well on social media. 

If this is what we‚Äôre used to in our lives, then trying to get into a habit of meditation can be a challenge. The monkey is angry that it doesn‚Äôt have branches to grasp so it starts looking for something to do, interesting things to think about, maybe things that you have an emotional attachment to at the moment. Naughty monkey!

So what can we do when our mind is restless and unsettled? We shouldn't try to control the mind - its very difficult to make the  mind do what we want, so we're more likely to be successful if we focus our efforts on the body. Of course, our bodies and our minds are fundamentally linked: our mind can live in our body when we focus our awareness on our walking, eating or brushing our teeth.

But our body also affects our emotional wellbeing and its easy to think of examples. When we eat or drink it can nourish us or it can make us anxious or unwell. Pain can influence our mindset as can hormones and many other things. When we take care of our body well, we make our mind happy and our monkey more restful. I would invite you to think of one wholesome change you can make to your diet or exercise routine that will nourish your body and put it into practice this week.

In the shorter term, we can calm our monkey mind by practising meditation in the body. You can try this right now by spending a few minutes focusing your awareness on each part of the body:

Breathing in, I am aware of my eyes. Breathing out, I smile to my eyes.

Then your shoulders, back, lungs etc. Practising in this way will ground you in the present moment and give your monkey mind a chance to rest.

But then after calming down, maybe by sleep, friends or family, coping mechanisms or something else, I completely forget about those feelings that could be very useful to my psychologist.

Like, I know what happened that day (for example, stress in class or a fight with mom), but I'm unable to access the full picture, that analysis my brain gave to me is fuzzy and in little disconnected thought puzzle pieces floating on my brain's sea.

What is that? My brain forgets it because it's part of the bad memory? Is that analysis considered part of a trauma? Is Asperger's syndrome pulling a prank on me? Are my coping mechanisms making me forget? I don't know.

Maybe I should just write them down the moment they happen. At least they get archived.

2998,"I‚Äôm stupidly calm about the fact that I was sexually abused and it confuses me.  
First of all, English is not my native language, so sorry if there are any mistakes.

My situation is this: I was sexually abused online, it was nothing more than video calls and videos that I shared with manipulators, this when I was 12-11 years old and years have passed and I am calm with that part of my past.

I think I handled it quite well, I discovered a philosophy that I like and practice and at that age I started exercising and I focused on living day to day and sometimes it affected me but now I don't care much I just see it as something that happened neither good nor bad something that happened so that I learned something. but I still feel confused that such serious shit and at such a young age I handle it so well.

2999,"how to calm anxiety induced mania?  So, about 3 weeks into one of the most heart destroying breakups with someone I thought was going to be with me forever, I'm(27M) having a lot of trouble not only getting that person(29F) out of my head, but moving on in general and being okay with not having them in my life. This leads to a spike in anxiety that leads to me going manic. I disregard myself and do things impulsively, I can't calm my head down no matter how much my logical side tries to, and I can never relax. It's gotten to a point where I can barely fall asleep without some sort of aid(alcohol, melatonin) because I think of them and get triggered into a bout of anxiety. 

Pretty much I just want to know if anyone else in here has had similar trigger points, and if so, what are some ways you have learned to cope with it and lessen the effects of this anxiety. 

I should mention, I can't afford therapy, I'm already on medication but it hasn't had time to take full hold yet, and I can't smoke weed for job purposes and because I get sick when I do haha.

I don't know if I'm actually struggling with a mental health condition, since I'm yet to visit a doctor one day. Like in, I might be medically fine, many deal with sadness, loneliness, irritability, poor social skills, go NEET, and my loneliness and NEETness just last a bit longer, but are perfectly normal. This (and ""what am I going to say there?"") is what I say to myself to delay going to hospital.

""This is not a plea for attention, since I'm no more here to seek it. I, however, needed attention. Everyone does. In a utopia, this wish wouldn't be shameful, but we were born in hell instead.

Ma, pa, this had to end, just like with tooth pain. I'd endured my tooth for half a year and appendicitis for three days. This has been going on for years, though. Not one or two. Torment. You couldn't help me: I'm you and you're me (the product of your upbringing and the source of my upbringing; together are the product of this sick society), and if I couldn't help me otherwise, you also couldn't. Don't have regrets. This is what I've been dreaming for.

S., I know life is tough for you. When one thinks about it rationally, tougher than for me. Life in a new place is full of difficulties. We were bad friends to each other, I didn't understand you, and you didn't understand me, but it doesn't cancel anything out. I wish you professional success and ability to travel a lot.

P. and A. whom I met last July, your contribution to my life this half a year was invaluable. I'd like to know you longer: go to school together, be childhood friends, live next door. You should already know without me telling you that you are wonderful people, affectionate and friendly. Don't be too sad! With what you're filled with, you are going to have as good lives as possible in these lacking growth conditions. I love you.

To all who were occasionally kind to me, thank you for being in my life. I didn't want to participate in my own life, but you participated in it from time to time out of your will. I wish you warmth and patience in this cold, defective world.""",Relaxed

**So here's another crazy idea: what if you could hire a trusted human/Redditor to help calm and relax you via video/audio call?**

They would be provided with some basic training in active listening, guided deep relaxation, stress reduction. They would also be ID checked and if they provide a criminal record/history certificate (eg. from FBI, Police, etc.), and they would get a verified badge.

Of course, it would not be a replacement for a doctor/therapist -- more of an additional SOS/extra source of support.

Trusted Redditors would be paid by the client, it may not be as much as a professional therapist, but certainly as much as an Uber/Doordash driver perhaps (anywhere from say $10 to $25/hr, depending on skill, experience -- up to the Redditor to decide what to charge).

Story
All the screaming, belittling, arguing happened when A had a kid, primarily my cousin. U screams, yells, and verbally abuses me and my sister like 3 times a week, and treats my cousin like the golden child. He wants THE BEST OF THE BEST out of us, but not in a good way.

He calls my sister‚Äôs hair a rat nest, and threatens to cut it off if she doesn‚Äôt make it look nice, even though she has naturally curly hair. He does that about my hair, saying how it looks like a mop and forces me to put globs of gel in it to make it look nice, even though my hair gets all crusty and hard, making me take longer in the shower, which makes him even more mad.

I felt bad and got back together but we said really shitty things to each other on the break up and we have been not talking much. I have been thinking about myself and how I have been before the fight. I held back alot on texting like I always do as much as I can. I get worried and overthink, maybe insecure so it becomes hell on me when I haven't heard from her in a couple days or when things ""feel"" wrong.

He‚Äôs now married and looks very happy and in love with his beautiful, gorgeous wife who I happen to have gone to high school with for a brief time. He ghosted me and it wrecked my life for a full year. It‚Äôs a heartbreak that for whatever reason still pops up in my head from time to time, despite me dating him for only a mere 3 months max. 

I just ended a 6 and a half year relationship a few months ago because it was going no where. He disrespected me by looking at other women, being sneaky and god knows what else. I‚Äôm now 27 and live back with my parents feeling lost. 

I started getting anxious at the thought of no one ever loving me the ‚Äúright way‚Äù and anxious over the thought of never falling in love. I think I cared about my ex, but deep down knew it wasn‚Äôt love I felt but more so a familiarity type of feeling. I just happened to have gotten used to him. We had nothing in common. 

The only way I‚Äôm able to sleep and shut my mind down is if I visualize myself stepping out of my body. I‚Äôm looking at myself lay in bed and immediately feel a sense of relief. I think about how her (my) problems aren‚Äôt ‚Äúmy‚Äù problems. I look at her ‚Äúme‚Äù and think well she can handle it, I think she‚Äôll be okay. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt admit that I transform myself into a cat once I step out of myself. It goes even further. I‚Äôm now a cat and step out into the neighborhood and walk in the dark. For whatever reason it‚Äôs soothing to imagine I‚Äôm just an animal with no human emotions, no worries or fears. 

This has been routine now when I‚Äôm trying to sleep, but I catch myself doing it when I feel overwhelmed with my emotions. It truly helps to step outside of myself and pretend I‚Äôm no longer me.

Today my mother(48?) told me that I (an Indian Muslim living in India) need to loose weight and my dad will ‚Äúmarry me off‚Äù in a year. A little background info here is that I‚Äôm quite fat, in class 2 obese category. My parents keep taunting to get me to loose weight ever since I was a kid. Im aware of my weight and the problems with it and am currently struggling to lose it.today My mom said I need to lose weight quickly so they can get me married.

She said that since I‚Äôm not pursuing any ‚Äúesteemed‚Äù college course, they don‚Äôt have to wait any longer. Im currently still a 12th grade graduate. I haven‚Äôt attended college yet. My education has been very troubled for the past 3 years. And just this year I got around enrolling myself in an online college in the Bachelor of Business Administration program.

So when my mother told me this, I didn‚Äôt show her any emotions because she doesn‚Äôt support my feelings and she‚Äôll only say some more mean stuff if she sees I‚Äôm being weak.I maintained a poker face as well as I could and ended the convo with ‚Äúyes I‚Äôll do that‚Äù . I tried to tel her ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get married‚Äù and she kept on saying that it‚Äôs their religious duty by god to marry me off (I‚Äôm a Muslim). Hence I said ok and left.

Ever since I left that room, my brain and body are in a turbulence. I can literally feel my hands shaking and my head feels so heavy and I can‚Äôt stop crying and worrying. I don‚Äôt want to go through this. I Can‚Äôt let them throw me into this. They‚Äôve done something similar when I was 9 and now again. 

Please tell me how to think through this rationally. I want to calm myself, get through the year working hard and find a way to make money online. So that I can move out as soon as freaking possible. But I need to think and talk straight. Which I can‚Äôt. All my childhood painful memories and nightmares are just flashing before me. And I don‚Äôt want to cry in front of my parents because they say even more mean stuff and aren‚Äôt understanding at all. I don‚Äôt want them to suppress me even more after seeing how weak I am.

But I don‚Äôt even have any money to just run away from home and rent an apartment even. I‚Äôm not independent yet.

3056,"Flip out, cry, calm down, repeat  Trigger warning: talk of suicide
Also: Sorry for it being so long

Lately, I've been flipping out. Yell and cuss at everyone over something that can be talked through then bawl like a baby until I'm able to talk out what's going on in my head. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm working through it with my therapist and trying to keep in mind that there are other emotions involved, but I'm really lost.

So backstory, I have C-PTSD, Anxiety, and Major Depressive Disorder. It started when had one huge fight with my husband's niece (we were paying her to watch my toddler so I could have a meeting with my boss and she called my MIL to pick the toddler up because she wanted to go out with friends) and my step-daughter over my step-daughter being a teenager (disrespect, doing what I specifically asked her not to, etc). I lost it. Like completely lost it. It typically takes ALOT to make me that angry but since then, it's taken a lot less. Since this particular incident, I have not sent her back to be watched by that niece (she has a habit of rushing us anytime we ask her to watch her).

We live in a household of 9. 7 adults (myself included), 2 teenagers, and a toddler. I work 2 accounting jobs and have a side craft hobby on the side for extra income (sometimes). I do most of the cleaning, all of the cooking, and the after dinner cleanup. I do the laundry, straighting up, etc. If I don't do these things (and sometimes I have no energy to do so), everything piles up and no one cares. My husband has a full time job and helps his dad with his business here and there. Because of his work schedule, I do all the doctor's appointment things for all 3 kids, dropoff/pickup for school, etc. The teens do sports, the toddler does tumbling and about to start dance. My life is hectic. The only time I get ro relax is when the toddler goes to sleep (in our bed) and by then, I'm too tired to do anything. Until recently, I had no family of my own around me less than an hour away. My mom lives 5 minutes from me now but I don't like talking to her about things like this. She has her own stuff to worry about. 

Anyway, back to the issue at hand. Since the big fight with my niece/step-daughter, I've been dealing more and more with blowing up at my kids, husband, and his family. To the point it's really hurting my relationship with all around me. Do I mean to? No. And I always feel SUPER guilty afterward and bawl like a baby apologizing to everyone. 

I was on Effexor 150mg; however, after missing 1 dose (I got it mixed up so really I went 36 hours without), I have a suicide attempt (plan & letter but asked husband for help before the actual attempt).  After speaking to my doctor, we are tapering me off as I'm not comfortable with being that close. The start of these blow ups was before I started coming off the Effexor. I'm currently on day 4 without it completely.

In the middle of ALL OF THIS, I've also been fighting with hubby's family about step-daughter. Apparently I keep her ""locked up, ground her for no reason,"" and ""don't let her go anywhere without her sister."" Although I tried to deal with it like an adult, keep my anger reeled in, and explain that had she come to us and asked about it instead of listening to a teenager, she would know that I have not made any decision to ground her in the last 2 months (it's either a joint agreement or her father is now in charge of that), she has been gone to a friend's house or had someone over everyday for 2 weeks (up to this point), and my toddler is 9 times out of 10 with ME from the time I get home to the time I go to work the next day. I rarely ask step-daughter to watch her. But this fight has been going on for WEEKS. And this particular argument almost ended my 10 year relationship.

So more and more, I've had this process of blowing up, crying, calming down, and repeat. My husband says that he doesn't know which person he's going to come home to or wake up to everyday. And it's always trivial things. For example, we were supposed to go out and get a few things and spend time with the kids, but hubby let step-daughter go with MIL to see someone for a while. I blew up and step-daughter texted my husband saying I made her ""feel like the lowest person in the world."" 

I don't want to be this way. I'm trying so hard not to be this person and it feels like I should have just succeeded in my attempt as everyone would be a lot happier. And that's exactly where my mind goes. Every. Single. Time. I have so much guilt everytime it happens. I always apologize, explain that it's not okay for me to act like that, and try to explain my feelings. But it's driving more and more of a wedge between us. My 2-year old, at the spongey part of her life (because toddlers soak stuff up like sponges), does not need to see this side of me and learn from it. It's not okay. But neither am I. I want to be okay for my daughter and break this generational trauma. I want to be okay for my stepkids. They do not need to see this either. I want to be okay for my husband. I want to be okay for myself. 

I'm in therapy once a week and I try to work through this. I try to keep in mind how others feel. I try to consider how tired or overwhelmed my husband probably is. I TRY NOT to be this way. Could anyone help me with this? Advice, support, etc? Please please and thank you.",Relaxed

If I do something strange, I can I the moment be aware that this is unusual, but I also realize that is is actually happening to me for real. However, when I take antipsychotics after an episode, some time passes, and I think what I did was weird and did not make sense. But my judgement of what is really happening has been unstable lately. I sometimes mix people around or feel as of they are connected in a way they may not be doing intentionally, but when I'm stressed I think they are doing it on purpose. But my thoughts are really making a negative impact on my relationships with people. Sometimes it's hard to say things when it's unexpected what is to be answered. When I cannot predict things, I get scared that it might get predicted by someone else. For example in conversation, I feel controlled sometimes to say certain things because they make sense technically, and on topic, but it feels like I am just being lead into saying and thinking about it unnaturally. Recently I am always in a state of haze, its like I can feel things like clothes or time passing or my organs moving, or me thinking as if my thoughts are physical but it feels very unnatural, I feel very disconnected from my body and surroundings. Times when I feel normal happen as if its happening in some sort of shield, I can talk normally and do activities with friends and boyfriend, do hobbies but it's like I have to constantly keep it up either by certain actions or need to keep reassuring myself of seeking reassurance from others that everything is okay. Because sometimes people and things, like furniture or places seem untrustworthy, it's like I have to keep running away even if I know it's weird and nothing is going to happen, I keep feeling it going wrong way, and my thinking rationally becomes painful, I either shut down completely or just follow my instincts which can put me in dangerous situations.

3078,"Weird ""Panic, Calm yet Intense"" Feeling Inside My Head  Not sure if this is the place to post this, but while lying down trying to sleep, very rarely while my eyes are closed I will get this odd feeling in my head like things are extremely ""close"" to me, but also far away...like I could open my eyes and see the wall in my room and know its close, but then it also appears extremely far away, giving an odd ""reality-bending"" feeling. It makes me feel very very uneasy, like things around me are calm and still, yet at the same time extremely intense and crazy.

I would only get about 10% of this feeling maybe once every 5-6 months, so its pretty rare. However, just a month ago while camping, I had an extremely bad version of it while sleeping/dreaming, and I woke up in disarray, covered in sweat and my Apple Watch gave me a warning that my heart rate was abnormally high.

I genuinely believed I was going to die for some reason, still groggy in-between dreaming and reality and I felt like everything was bouncing super close to me and then going really far away, like my vision was on a rubber band. It's so hard to explain this feeling in words, but it was like I was in hell...it took me about 10 minutes to grasp reality and realize where I was and that I was okay, but I have never experienced anything like that before.

I am a 26 year old male, 6'4"", 215lbs, don't smoke or do drugs, and exercise almost daily, just in case anyone was thinking I was taking LSD or something to experience this, which is not the case. Hope someone here can point me in the right direction as to what this may be or may have been caused by.",Relaxed

3090,"Help with staying calm/positive while alone with oneself?  I hope this is the correct place for this!! I've thought about this for a while and I finally decided to consult Reddit. Sorry if this gets long!! TLDR at the bottom.

Basically, I'll be staying home by myself for about a week- the longest I ever have.

I'm not exactly scared that I'll end up hurting myself, but I AM scared that I'll have a breakdown of some kind... When I'm alone with myself for too long, I tend to get insanely paranoid, and I self-loath and freak out and jump at every little thing, and it only gets worse and worse as night time approaches. I feel watched, I get too nervous to move, I mistake every little noise and light as some kind of predator. I work second shift so I already stay up late, but my anxiety has forced me to stay up until the sun rises on more than one occasion.

I'm also insanely scared of the dark so if something happens and the power goes out while I'm home alone I'm absolutely certain that I'll have a meltdown, but that's a bridge I'll have to cross when I get to it, LOL

I'll have two dogs and a cat with me, I live in a rural area around other family member's houses so it's not like I'll be stranded.  I'm making a list of activities to keep myself busy and happy, and I'll be trying to keep in contact with friends/family throughout the day/night.

I just wanted to know if anyone had any tips for keeping oneself calm and grounded, especially at night? I'm so sorry that this is so vague, and I probably worded this to sound silly, but it really is something that I'm feeling immense dread over and I truly would appreciate any help or advice that could be offered. Thank you all in advance!!

TLDR: I'm a person who struggles with paranoia/anxiety/depression, staying home almost completely alone for almost a full week, and I'd enjoy some tips on how to keep myself calm and positive while being alone with myself for so long.

EDIT: IDK if anyone will see this, but I just wanted to say thank you!! I got through the entire week and I actually had a super lovely time!

A big thank you to everyone who gave advice!!

3110,"Your mind is like a movie‚Äôs Director commentary with no off button; but you can calm it  Imagine you‚Äôre trying to watch a movie, you‚Äôve accidentally switched the directors commentary on and you don‚Äôt know how to switch it off. Newt is telling Ripley that they ""mostly come at night - mostly"" but you can‚Äôt hear that because James Cameron is going on and on about the sets in the next scene and the miniatures used in the last scene. You‚Äôre trying to concentrate but you can‚Äôt - the judgement of what's happening on screen, talk about the past, talk about the future is distracting you from enjoying the substance, the reality, the here and now.


Our minds are like that too. Its difficult for us to be in the present moment because we‚Äôre being pulled out of it so often by our thoughts: we have regrets from the past, we have worries about the future. Meditation is simply the practice is being present with our experience, here and now. Making the active choice to focus your awareness on what's happening to you without judging that experience, without reacting to it an without being swept away by how we feel.


Now that's easier said than done - the reason why we call it a practice is because it takes effort and time. But it doesn‚Äôt take much: doing it for a few minutes a day for a month will make a noticeable, measurable difference. What is that difference? Lets say you‚Äôre feeling stressed, you had a bad day at work and your partner says something innocent that you take exception to. Meditation is the difference between reacting by saying something tetchy that you regret and choosing to breathe for a few seconds where you notice that you‚Äôre stressed, you notice your reaction to what they said and you choose to say something  else. Or find out what they intended. Or not speak at all.


Meditation is not just a way to reduce stress after the fact. It allows you reduce the impact that stressful situations have on you as they‚Äôre happening. More than that, it helps you to understand yourself and why you experience difficult emotions in a particular situation. And taking an even bigger step back, it can help you make choices in structuring your life that cultivate calmness and happiness. 



But for now its enough to hold in your awareness that all you have to do to live a calmer, happier life is to spend more time in the present moment. And it works: anxiety ruled my life for the first thirty years. I was ashamed of it, I was afraid of other people finding out how much I struggled. I could barely speak to people I didn‚Äôt know. I avoided social situations or anywhere with crowds. I still experience anxiety but mindfulness has allowed me to accept it and reduce the harm I experience, and if it helped me it might help you. 


The last thing I would say is give meditation a chance. You have absolutely nothing to lose and the whole world to gain. I said that practicing a little every day for a few weeks will make a noticeable difference. Practicing for year will transform your life, your relationships, how you view yourself, your perspective on the world. Bear in mind that we‚Äôre trained through modern life to expect immediate payoff and instant gratification but mindfulness will require you to be patient. I‚Äôve heard lots of people say ""I tried it and it didn‚Äôt work"" after trying to meditate on their own for five minutes once. Give it time, meditate with other people and be patient with yourself.

I thought that I were about to hit my limit until all of a sudden, poof, all of the excessive emotions were gone. I were still in the store with the present situation still ongoing, but I was calm. More than that, I were a little out of it as were a little slow concerning my reaction speed and generally understanding what people were saying to me. I'm still incredibly calm as I'm writing this, but is this normal? Does stuff like this normally happen when things feel like they are out of control? I've only ever snapped with anger before in extreme situations, but that is incredibly rare and has only happened 3 times in my life. What happened to me?",Relaxed
