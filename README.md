#Stress Classifier Model Based on BERT 
Overview This project involves creating a stress classifier model using BERT. The dataset has been scraped from Reddit and includes necessary files for training the model. Due to file size limitations, the trained model (in .h5 format) is not included in this repository but can be added after training.

Dataset The dataset consists of text data scraped from Reddit and is split into training, validation, and test sets:

train.csv: Training data validation.csv: Validation data test.csv: Test data Each CSV file includes the following columns:

text: The Reddit post text. label: The corresponding label indicating stress (1) or no stress (0). Training the Model The train.py script is used to train the stress classifier model. It utilizes BERT for feature extraction and fine-tuning.

Steps: Ensure all dependencies are installed. Run the training script to preprocess the data, fine-tune the BERT model on the training data, and save the model to stress_classifier_model.h5. Evaluating the Model To evaluate the trained model, use the evaluate.py script. This script will load the trained model and evaluate it on the test dataset.

Steps: Ensure the trained model (stress_classifier_model.h5) is present in the root directory. Run the evaluation script to get performance metrics. Usage After training and evaluating the model, you can use it to predict stress in new text data. Example usage code can be added to a new script or a Jupyter Notebook.

Adding the Trained Model After training, the stress_classifier_model.h5 file will be generated. Due to file size limitations, this file cannot be uploaded directly here.

Steps to Add the Trained Model: Train the model using train.py. The trained model will be saved as stress_classifier_model.h5. Manually add this file to the project root directory for future use.

This README provides an overview of the project structure, setup instructions, and how to train, evaluate, and use the stress classifier model. For more detailed information and advanced usage, refer to the provided scripts and the Hugging Face documentation.
